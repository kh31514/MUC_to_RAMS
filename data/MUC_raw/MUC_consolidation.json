IN\nRESPONSE TO THEIR REFUSAL, LET US NOT VOTE IN THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS; LET US\nVOTE IN THE 15 SEPTEMBER ELECTIONS.\n\n   THAT MUST BE THE PEOPLE'S RESPONSE TO THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS.  THE BALLOT\nBOXES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE [WORD INDISTINCT] WILL BE SABOTAGED, AND PERSONNEL\nPARTICIPATING IN THAT ELECTION GAME WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY ANNIHILATED,\nBECAUSE THEIR PARTICIPATION MEANS THEY AGREE WITH THE ELECTIONS AND SUPPORT\nTHE WORSENING OF THE WAR.\n\n   NO TO THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS, BECAUSE THEY ARE A DEMAGOGIC AND FRAUDULENT\nMANEUVER AND BECAUSE THEY ARE A DENIAL OF PEACE.",

      "text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 6 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH\nCOLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF OF\nTHE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, BY UNIDENTIFIED SALVADORAN AND\nINTERNATIONAL REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] COLONEL, WHAT\nSPECIFIC MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN AGAINST THE MISSILES?\n\n   [PONCE] I BELIEVE THAT SPECIFIC MEASURES WE HAVE ADOPTED HAVE GIVEN\nUS GOOD RESULTS.  THEY HAVE LAUNCHED FOUR SA-7'S IN THE ZACATECOLUCA\nAREA; HOWEVER, OUR PILOTS HAVE SKILLFULLY AVOIDED THE ROCKETS OR\nMISSILES, WHICH DID NOT HIT THEIR AIRCRAFT.  WE ARE ADOPTING MEASURES\nTHAT ARE GIVING RESULTS.  WE MUST ALSO CLARIFY THAT WE FEEL THAT SINCE\nTHE LIGHT AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING THESE MISSILES DID NOT HAVE A NORMAL\nLANDING AND THE MISSILES WERE NOT IN THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGE, IT IS\nPOSSIBLE THAT THEY SUFFERED SOME FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE WHEN THE PLANE\nCRASHED SOUTH OF ZACATECOLUCA.  THANK GOD, [WORDS INDISTINCT]\n\n   [REPORTER] DO YOU THINK THAT THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN\nPRESIDENTS CAN OPEN NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR RESUMING TALKS WITH THE\nFMLN?  DO YOU THINK THAT THIS SUMMIT COULD BRING ABOUT NEW STEPS\nTOWARD A DIALOGUE?\n\n   [PONCE] YES, I THINK THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SINCE THE\nBEGINNING OF THE YEAR HAS OPENED THIS POSSIBILITY AND IS WILLING TO\nTALK ON A PERMANENT BASIS.  I THINK THAT AT THIS TIME IT WOULD BE A\nPOSITIVE STEP IN THE POLITICAL FIELD.\n\n   HOWEVER, IN THE MILITARY FIELD, WHERE THE FMLN HAS ATTACKED US IN\nAN IRRATIONAL AND VIOLENT WAY IN THE MAIN CITIES, THE ARMED FORCES IS\nREPLYING, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO REPLY.  WE WILL COMPLETELY DEFEAT\nTHE FMLN.\n\n   BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR UNITS, WE HAVE\nINFLICTED 1,902 DEAD, 1,209 WOUNDED, AND 44 TERRORISTS HAVE DESERTED\nAND TURNED THEMSELVES IN TO THE AUTHORITIES.  WE HAVE CONFISCATED A\nLARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS.  I WILL GIVE YOU THE QUANTITIES: 25\nANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES -- ONE RED EYE AND 24 SA-7'S -- 915 RIFLES, 12\nCARBINES, 11 SHOTGUNS, 156 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 49 MORTARS,\n45 MACHINEGUNS, 41 SUBMACHINEGUNS, 67 REVOLVERS AND PISTOLS, 23\nRADIOS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES.\n\n   I MUST STRESS THAT THE FMLN HAS GATHERED ALL THESE WEAPONS WITH\nSUPPPORT FROM ABROAD.  IT IS A LARGE ARSENAL.\n\n   I MUST ALSO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE WEAPONS WE FOUND HAD BEEN\nABANDONED, WHICH MEANS THAT THE FMLN HAS HAD MANY DESERTIONS.  WE HAVE\nALSO FOUND WEAPONS IN HOUSES, THANKS TO THE COLLABORATION OF THE\nCIVILIAN POPULATION.\n\n   WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE FMLN HAS KIDNAPPED A LARGE NUMBER OF\nYOUTHS HERE IN THE SAN SALVADOR AREA AND MAINLY IN USULUTAN, AS WELL\nAS IN CHALATENANGO.  THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO FILL IN THE\nNUMBER OF CASUALTIES THEY HAVE SUFFERED WITH YOUTHS.  THIS ALSO MEANS\nTHAT THEIR EFFICIENCY WILL BE VERY LOW.\n\n   [REPORTER] I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS A\nLEAFLET ISSUED BY THE AIR FORCE, WHICH WAS DROPPED FROM AIRPLANES AND\nALSO DISTRIBUTED ON THE STREETS.  THE LEAFLET URGES SALVADORAN\nPATRIOTS TO DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND, THEIR PROPERTIES, AND LIVES.  IT\nALSO SAYS THAT IF NECESSARY, TERRORISTS MUST BE KILLED, AS WELL AS\nTHEIR INTERNATIONALIST ALLIES.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THIS LEAFLET?\nIS IT NOT AN INVITATION TO KILL FOREIGNERS IN THIS COUNTRY?\n\n   [PONCE] I DO NOT THINK SO, BECAUSE THE LEAFLETS MENTION\nINTERNATIONALISTS, WHO ARE FIGHTING ALONG WITH THE FMLN.

      "text": "   CLANDESTINE, NO DATE (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH FMLN\nCOMMANDER GONZALEZ BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]\n[REPORTER] COMMANDER, WHAT CAN THE POPULAR MOVEMENT, THE LABOR UNIONS,\nAND THE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS DO IN THE FACE OF A GOVERNMENT AND\nA MILITARY LEADERSHIP THAT CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF ATTACK, THIS TYPE OF\nMASSACRE, IN A LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT OFFERS NO GUARANTEE TO THE POPULAR\nMOVEMENT?  WHAT CAN THE POPULAR MOVEMENT DO?\n\n   [GONZALEZ] I BELIEVE THAT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT IS CLOSING ALL\nTHE ROADS TO A PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THIS CONFLICT.  THROUGH REPRESSION\nIT IS CLOSING OFF THE POSSIBILITY OF LABOR UNIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS\nRESOLVING THEIR PROBLEMS PEACEFULLY.  THE GOVERNMENT IS CLOSING OFF\nTHE POSSIBILITY OF NEGOTIATIONS.  THE ARMY AND THE CRISTIANI\nGOVERNMENT ARE OPPOSED TO TRUE NEGOTIATIONS.  THE PEOPLE HAVE NO\nALTERNATIVE.  IN EL SALVADOR THERE IS A LATENT PATH, THE PATH OF ARMED\nACTIONS.  AT THIS MOMENT, AS THIS GOVERNMENT INCREASES REPRESSION,\nARMED ACTIONS BECOME INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, ARMED ACTIONS TO FIND\nSOLUTIONS TO THE CONFLICT, ARMED ACTIONS TO STOP THE REPRESSION BY THE\nREGIME.\n\n   THE WORKERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS AND LABOR UNIONS ARE ENTITLED TO\nDEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEIR LABOR BENEFITS.  DEFENSE IS LEGITIMATE.\nIT IS LEGITIMATE FOR THE WORKERS TO DECIDE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES THE\nARMED WAY, THROUGH VIOLENCE.  IT IS THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, PONCE,\nAND THE HIGH COMMAND WHO ARE LEAVING THE WORKERS NO ALTERNATIVE.\n\n   [REPORTER] TO CONCLUDE, COMMANDER: IN RECENT HOURS THERE HAVE BEEN\nATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL, INCLUDING BOMB ATTACKS ON THE RESIDENCES OF\nDEMOCRATIC LEADERS SUCH AS RUBEN ZAMORA AND ARONETE DIAZ, AN ATTACK ON\nTHE RESIDENCE OF COLONEL CARRANZA, AND AN ATTACK ON A RELATIVE OF\nCOLONEL LOPEZ HUILA, AMONG OTHERS.  THE ARMED FORCES AND THE\nGOVERNMENT HAVE PUBLICLY SAID THAT THE FMLN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE\nATTACKS.\n\n   [GONZALEZ] OUR ARMED ACTIONS ARE HIGHLY JUST AND HAVE POLITICAL\nMOTIVATIONS.  OUR OBJECTIVES ARE STRICTLY MILITARY.  ALL OUR GUERRILLA\nUNITS FUNCTION ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE, BE IT IN THE RURAL AREAS\nOR IN THE CITIES WHERE OUR URBAN COMMANDOS OPERATE.\n\n   THE ATTACK ON THE ARMED FORCES STAFF INSTALLATIONS AND OTHER\nOPERATIONS AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS ARE OUR RESPONSIBILITY.  THE\nFMLN'S POLICY IS NOT TO ATTACK RELATIVES OF MILITARY MEN OR\nPOLITICIANS.  THE HIGH COMMAND HAS BEEN TRYING TO CONFUSE THE PEOPLE\nHERE AND ABROAD.  WHAT IS ITS OBJECTIVE?  TO COVER UP ITS REPRESSIVE\nPOLICY.  IT IS ESCALATING ITS ACTIONS.  IT HAS GONE FROM THE SELECTIVE\nCAPTURE AND MURDER OF LEADERS TO MASS ARRESTS, AND FROM MASS ARRESTS\nIT HAS MOVED INTO GENOCIDE AND INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS.\n\n   IT IS CLEAR THAT ITS OBJECTIVE IS THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THE\nGOVERNMENT SAID IT IN SAN JOSE.  IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE HIGH COMMAND\nIS TRYING TO CREATE CONFUSION, BUT THE PEOPLE ABROAD AND WE KNOW THAT\nOUR ACTIONS ARE AIMED AT MILITARY OBJECTIVES.",

WHAT CAN THE POPULAR MOVEMENT DO?\n\n   [GONZALEZ] I BELIEVE THAT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT IS CLOSING ALL\nTHE ROADS TO A PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THIS CONFLICT.  THROUGH REPRESSION\nIT IS CLOSING OFF THE POSSIBILITY OF LABOR UNIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS\nRESOLVING THEIR PROBLEMS PEACEFULLY.  THE GOVERNMENT IS CLOSING OFF\nTHE POSSIBILITY OF NEGOTIATIONS.  THE ARMY AND THE CRISTIANI\nGOVERNMENT ARE OPPOSED TO TRUE NEGOTIATIONS.  THE PEOPLE HAVE NO\nALTERNATIVE.  IN EL SALVADOR THERE IS A LATENT PATH, THE PATH OF ARMED\nACTIONS.  AT THIS MOMENT, AS THIS GOVERNMENT INCREASES REPRESSION,\nARMED ACTIONS BECOME INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, ARMED ACTIONS TO FIND\nSOLUTIONS TO THE CONFLICT, ARMED ACTIONS TO STOP THE REPRESSION BY THE\nREGIME.\n\n   THE WORKERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS AND LABOR UNIONS ARE ENTITLED TO\nDEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEIR LABOR BENEFITS.  DEFENSE IS LEGITIMATE.\nIT IS LEGITIMATE FOR THE WORKERS TO DECIDE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES THE\nARMED WAY, THROUGH VIOLENCE.  IT IS THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, PONCE,\nAND THE HIGH COMMAND WHO ARE LEAVING THE WORKERS NO ALTERNATIVE.\n\n   [REPORTER] TO CONCLUDE, COMMANDER: IN RECENT HOURS THERE HAVE BEEN\nATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL, INCLUDING BOMB ATTACKS ON THE RESIDENCES OF\nDEMOCRATIC LEADERS SUCH AS RUBEN ZAMORA AND ARONETE DIAZ, AN ATTACK ON\nTHE RESIDENCE OF COLONEL CARRANZA, AND AN ATTACK ON A RELATIVE OF\nCOLONEL LOPEZ HUILA, AMONG OTHERS.  THE ARMED FORCES AND THE\nGOVERNMENT HAVE PUBLICLY SAID THAT THE FMLN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE\nATTACKS.\n\n   [GONZALEZ] OUR ARMED ACTIONS ARE HIGHLY JUST AND HAVE POLITICAL\nMOTIVATIONS.  OUR OBJECTIVES ARE STRICTLY MILITARY.  ALL OUR GUERRILLA\nUNITS FUNCTION ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE, BE IT IN THE RURAL AREAS\nOR IN THE CITIES WHERE OUR URBAN COMMANDOS OPERATE.\n\n   THE ATTACK ON THE ARMED FORCES STAFF INSTALLATIONS AND OTHER\nOPERATIONS AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS ARE OUR RESPONSIBILITY.  THE\nFMLN'S POLICY IS NOT TO ATTACK RELATIVES OF MILITARY MEN OR\nPOLITICIANS.  THE HIGH COMMAND HAS BEEN TRYING TO CONFUSE THE PEOPLE\nHERE AND ABROAD.  WHAT IS ITS OBJECTIVE?  TO COVER UP ITS REPRESSIVE\nPOLICY.  IT IS ESCALATING ITS ACTIONS.  IT HAS GONE FROM THE SELECTIVE\nCAPTURE AND MURDER OF LEADERS TO MASS ARRESTS, AND FROM MASS ARRESTS\nIT HAS MOVED INTO GENOCIDE AND INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS.\n\n   IT IS CLEAR THAT ITS OBJECTIVE IS THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THE\nGOVERNMENT SAID IT IN SAN JOSE.  IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE HIGH COMMAND\nIS TRYING TO CREATE CONFUSION, BUT THE PEOPLE ABROAD AND WE KNOW THAT\nOUR ACTIONS ARE AIMED AT MILITARY OBJECTIVES.",

      "text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 9 JAN 90 -- [TEXT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS EXPRESSED\nSATISFACTION WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE CASE OF THE MURDERED JESUITS AND\nIS ENCOURAGING THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR THE PERPETRATORS OF\nTHIS CRIME.\n\n   MONSIGNOR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ TODAY STATED THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS\nPLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS REGARDING THE MURDER OF THE\nJESUIT PRIESTS.  HE SAID THAT IF THE SOLDIERS INVOLVED IN THE KILLING ARE\nPUNISHED, THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ONLY EARN INTERNATIONAL PRESTIGE, BUT WILL\nLAY THE GROUNDWORK TO CONSOLIDATE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN EL\nSALVADOR.\n\n   ROSA CHAVEZ SAID THAT IF THE KILLING IS SOLVED, THE PERIOD OF IMPUNITY\nTHAT HAS TARNISHED THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND COVERED UP A NUMBER OF CRIMES TO\nWHICH JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED WILL END.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ROSA CHAVEZ] IT SEEMS THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE\nRECOGNIZED FOR HAVING HAD THE COURAGE TO KEEP HIS PROMISE TO CONDUCT A\nTHOROUGH INVESTIGATION.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS NOT YET REVEALED THE\nDETAILS OF THIS CRIME BUT THAT HE WILL DO SO SOON.\n\n   HOWEVER, I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN SAID: THE CHURCH IS NOT\nINTERESTED IN LEARNING WHO THE MURDERERS ARE JUST FOR THE TRUTH TO COME\nOUT.  THE CHURCH WANTS THIS PUNISHMENT TO MEAN THAT IMPUNITY HAS ENDED IN EL\nSALVADOR; THAT THE POOR WILL FEEL CERTAIN THAT JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL FOR\nTHEM; THAT SO MANY CRIMES THAT HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN WILL BE SOLVED LITTLE BY\nLITTLE; BUT MAINLY, THAT FROM NOW ON, CRIMES WILL NO LONGER GO UNSOLVED.\n[END RECORDING]\n\n   MSGR ROSA CHAVEZ ADDED THAT THE TONE OF VERBAL VIOLENCE MUST BE LOWERED\nSINCE THIS ONLY RESULTS IN A USELESS CONFRONTATION AND PROMOTES A\nPOLARIZATION OF THE CONFLICT, AS WELL AS HINDERS ANY EFFORT TO APPLY\nJUSTICE.  HE SAID THAT THE VERBAL WAR IS AS HARMFUL AS IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE.\nHE SAID THAT IRRESPONSIBLE CHARGES AND ACCUSATIONS CONTINUE IN THE COUNTRY,\nAND THEY DO NOT HELP STRENGTHEN THE PEACE PROCESS.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ROSA CHAVEZ] IT IS IMPORTANT TO OVERCOME VERBAL\nVIOLENCE.  THIS MEANS THAT A CALM CLIMATE, A CLIMATE THAT IS AS IMPARTIAL AS\nPOSSIBLE, MUST BE SOUGHT TO DISCUSS ISSUES.  WE RECALL THAT LAST YEAR, MANY\nVIOLENT STATEMENTS WERE MADE.  MANY HARSH EXPRESSIONS WERE UTTERED.  [WORDS\nINDISTINCT] TOO MANY HEATED STATEMENTS PRINTED IN SOME NEWSPAPERS.  THE\nLANGUAGE USED IS TOO HARSH.  I THINK THAT TO OBTAIN JUSTICE, WE NEED A\nCALMER CLIMATE. [END RECORDING]\n\n   HE ADDED THAT A CLIMATE OF SERENITY AND RESPECT WOULD FACILITATE THE RIGHT\nCONDITIONS FOR A DIALOGUE THAT WOULD GUARANTEE MECHANISMS TO RECONCILE OUR\nSOCIETY.  HE URGED THE GOVERNMENT AND THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES TO CONTINUE\nMAKING PROGRESS IN THE REVIEW OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO REORGANIZE IT IN A\nWAY THAT WILL ALLOW THE HONEST ADMINSTRATION OF JUSTICE TO DO AWAY WITH\nIMPUNITY.",

      "text": "   CLANDESTINE, 13 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATION COMMENTARY]\n[TEXT] WHAT WE HAD PREDICTED HAS OCCURRED.  CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED THIS\nAFTERNOON THAT A COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, ONE SECOND LIEUTENANT, TWO\nSECOND SERGEANTS, AND TWO SOLDIERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE OF\nTHE JESUITS.\n\n   THE ACCUSATION AGAINST COLONEL BENAVIDES IS THE FOLLOWING: THAT THE\nMULTIPLE CRIME WAS COMMITTED IN THE SECTOR UNDER HIS COMMAND.  FROM THE\nLIEUTENANT ON DOWN, THE ACCUSATION IS THAT THEY DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE\nCRIME.  [WORDS INDISTINCT], AS CRISTIANI SAID, THAT IT WAS COL BENAVIDES,\nBUT IT WAS NOT COL BENAVIDES WHO ISSUED THE ORDER.  SO, THE QUESTION IS: WHO\nGAVE THE ORDER TO KILL THE JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS.  IN OUR VIEW, COL\nBENAVIDES WAS IMPLICATED SOLELY AS A MEANS OF PROPAGANDA AIMED AT THE U.S.\nCONGRESS.  IT IS CLEAR THAT COL BENAVIDES DID NOT GIVE THE ORDER.  HE\nPROBABLY DID NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE ACTION.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT\nWE KNOW ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND.  FIRST, HE IS NOT KNOWN TO HAVE CARRIED OUT\nACTS OF REPRESSION OR CORRUPTION.  OUR REPORT INDICATES THAT BENAVIDES HAS\n   MAINTAINED A POSITION IN FAVOR OF INSTITUTIONS AND OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS.\nHE WAS DESCRIBED AS AN ACTIVE, STUDIOUS AND NOT REPRESSIVE CADET, ONE OF THE\nFEW EXCEPTIONS IN LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1977 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE\nCAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY].  IN OTHER WORDS, FOR THE\nLA TANDONA, A GANG OF ASSASSINS, HE IS A PERFECT SCAPEGOAT.\n\n   THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUITS WAS NOT A PERSONAL DECISION.  IT WAS PART OF\nTHE ARMED FORCES' COUNTEROFFENSIVE ACTIONS DURING THE NOVEMBER BATTLES.  IT\nWAS A COLD-BLOODED, PREMEDITATED PLAN EXECUTED TO DECAPITATE THE PEOPLE'S\nMOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION.  LET US REMEMBER THE THREATS AGAINST\nFATHER ELLACURIA OVER THE NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK PRIOR TO THE\nASSASSINATION.  LET US REMEMBER THAT BETWEEN THE NIGHT OF 15 NOVEMBER AND\nEARLY MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, SEVERAL OFFICES OF LABOR UNIONS AND HOUSES OF\nOPPOSITION MEMBERS WERE ATTACKED.  LET US REMEMBER THAT AFTER THE MASSSACRE\nOF THE JESUITS, THE OFFICERS SHOUTED OVER LOUDSPEAKERS THAT THEY HAD KILLED\nELLACURIA AND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CONTINUE KILLING COMMUNISTS.  THE\nBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR WAS A WITNESS TO THIS.\n\n   IN OUR VIEW, THE ASSASSINS OF THE JESUITS WERE THOSE WHO APPEARED ON THE\nRADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK MAKING KNOWN THE RESULTS OF THE SO-CALLED HONOR\nCOMMISSION.  COL BENAVIDES WILL PROBABLY BE FREED IN A SHORT TIME AND BE\nAPPOINTED TO SOME POST ABROAD, OR HE MIGHT EXPERIENCE THE SAME FATE AS THAT\nOF CAPTAIN EDUARDO ALFONSO AVILA, WHO WENT IN AND OUT OF JAIL EACH TIME THAT\nMILITARY AID FOR EL SALVADOR WAS DISCUSSED IN THE U.S. CONGRESS.\n\n   HOWEVER, IN ANY CASE AND AS HAS ALWAYS OCCURRED, IT WILL BE THE\nLIEUTENANTS, THE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND THE SOLDIERS WHO CARRIED OUT\nAN ORDER WHO WILL PAY THE CONSEQUENCES.  WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN\nTHE CASES OF THE NUNS WHEN [WORDS INDISTINCT] A FEW SOLDIERS, THE MASSACRE\nOF SAN FRANCISCO, AND THE ASSASSINATION OF THE U.S. ADVISERS AND RODOLFO\nVIERA.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] ONCE AGAIN THE PEOPLE'S HOPES ARE FRUSTRATED, AS\nHAS HAPPENED IN SO MANY OTHER CASES.\n\n   THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS AGAIN CONFIRMS THAT TO, AS CRISTIANI\nSAID, GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS, WE HAVE TO OBTAIN DEMOCRACY, JUSTICE, AND\nSELF-DETERMINATION.",

TODAY,\nFOLLOWING ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE THE THREAT, THE AUTHORITIES\nSTEPPED UP SECURITY MEASURES FOR JARAMILLO.  AN ARMORED VEHICLE, 2 STATION\nWAGONS, 2 MOTORCYCLES, AND 15 MEN, ARMED TO THE TEETH AND NOT MORE THAN 30\nYEARS OLD, HAVE BECOME JARAMILLO'S GUARDIAN ANGELS.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GUTIERREZ] ARE YOU AFRAID?\n\n   [JARAMILLO] I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT ONLY BAD PEOPLE ARE AFRAID.\nHOWEVER, I WILL TELL YOU QUITE HONESTLY THAT I WOULD BE MORE AFRAID IF I\nHAD DECIDED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.  I AM DETERMINED TO REMAIN IN COLOMBIA\nAND TO CONTINUE WORKING FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE.\n\n   [GUTIERREZ] DO YOU FEEL THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS GIVING YOU ENOUGH\nPROTECTION?\n\n   [JARAMILLO] ONE THING IS THE DIRECT PROTECTION EFFICIENTLY PROVIDED BY\nTHE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY, AND ANOTHER THING IS THE\nGOVERNMENT'S POLICY FOR ELIMINATING THESE PROBLEMS.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THE\nGOVERNMENT'S POLICY FOR DISMANTLING THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS IS APPROPRIATE.\n\n   [GUTIERREZ] WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR HOME, DO YOU FEEL IT IS YOUR LAST DAY?\n\n   [JARAMILLO] I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AN OPTIMIST; I ALSO BELIEVE THAT YOU\nWILL DIE WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT.  WHEN I WALK OUT OF MY HOME, I TAKE ALL\nTHE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS. [END RECORDING]\n\n   JARAMILLO SAID HIS TWO SONS, WHO DO NOT LIVE IN BOGOTA, CALLED TO SAY\nTHEY WANTED TO SEE HIM.  JARAMILLO TOLD THEM TO STAY AWAY; HE FEARS THAT A\nSURPRISE ATTACK CAN HAPPEN AT ANY TIME AND THAT HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS MAY\nBECOME THE VICTIMS OF THIS NEVER-ENDING WAR.",

I BELIEVE EVIDENCE SHOULD NOT BE USED TO SPECULATE\nOR SHOULD NOT BE PUBLICLY PROMOTED.  IF PERTINENT EVIDENCE EXISTS, IT MUST\nBE SUBMITTED TO THE CORRESPONDING JUDGE, WHO IS THE EXCLUSIVE LEGAL\nAUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH IT AND, AFTER AN EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS, DETERMINE THE\nVALIDITY OF THE EVIDENCE. [END RECORDING]\n\n   NEVERTHELESS, MSGR ROMERO'S CASE HAS BEGUN TO HAVE THE ELEMENTS IT HAD\nLACKED FOR MORE THAN 8 YEARS.  THE LEGAL EVIDENCE MUST CONTAIN A SERIES OF\nCONDITIONS, AND ONLY THE JUDGE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAVE VALUE OR\nNOT.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIAL ALVARADO] THE VIDEO\nFOR EXAMPLE IS NOT EVIDENCE.  THE CONTENTS OF THE VIDEO MUST BE REAFFIRMED\nBY THE PERSONS WHO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER PARTICIPATED IN THE PREPARATION,\nAND THE ACCURACY OF THE CONTENTS NARRATED IN THAT VIDEO MUST BE LEGALLY\nDETERMINED. [END RECORDING]\n\n   GARCIA ALVARADO ADDED THAT THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE DECIDED A FEW\nHOURS AGO TO SUMMON FORMER ATTORNEY ROBERTO GIRON FLORES AND THE OFFICIALS\nJULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA AND GERARDO LE CHEVALIER TO GIVE THE EVIDENCE THEY\nCLAIM TO HAVE ON THE CASE.  BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFICIALS, THE LATTER TWO MUST\nMAKE SWORN STATEMENTS.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIAL ALVARADO] THE JUDGE\nIN CHARGE OF THE CASE HAS ISSUED RESOLUTIONS ORDERING THE SUMMONS OF IVON\nFLORES AND SWORN STATEMENTS FROM THE TWO OFFICIALS MENTIONED. [END\nRECORDING]\n\n   THESE NEW RESOLUTIONS OF THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE ON MSGR\nROMERO'S CASE WERE ISSUED AT THE REQUEST OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE,\nWHICH DEMONSTRATES, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID, THAT HE IS NOT AN\nUNDERTAKER OF TRIALS, MUCH LESS OF PEOPLE.\n\n   VICE PRESIDENT ANTONIO CASTILLO CLARAMOUNT SAID THE SUPREME COURT OF\nJUSTICE HAS THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO PUNISH THE MURDERERS OF MSGR ROMERO,\nINCLUDING MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON.  THE VICE PRESIDENT ALSO INSISTED THE\nLEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE THAT THOSE GUILTY OF THE\nMURDER OF MSGR ROMERO BE PUNISHED.  HOWEVER, HE STRESSED THE SUPREME COURT\nMUST ACT.  HE SAID THE INVESTIGATION MUST CONTINUE AND GATHER ALL THE\nEVIDENCE TO SOLVE THIS CASE, WHICH OCCURRED IN MARCH 1980.",

      "text": "   CLANDESTINE, 12 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [EDITORIAL] [TEXT] THE\nU.S.  CONGRESSMEN'S WORKTABLES ARE FILLED WITH SURPRISES.  THEY ARE TO\nRENEW THEIR SESSIONS IN 2 WEEKS' TIME, AND IMPORTANT MATTERS ARE\nWAITING TO BE DISCUSSED.\n\n   AFTER THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] STARTED ITS 11\nNOVEMBER OFFENSIVE WHICH BURIED THE ARMY'S PROPAGANDISTIC CLAIMS THAT IT HAD\nFINISHED OFF THE GUERRILLAS, ALONG CAME THE GREAT SURPRISES IN THE EAST\nEUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHEN THEY BROUGHT DOWN WALLS WITHOUT HAVING TO RESORT TO\nMILITARY INVASIONS AND ATTAINED A DEMOCRATIC OPENING.  ENDING THE YEAR, THE\nWORLD WAS SURPRISED WITH THE BRUTAL U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA.\n\n   NOW, WHEN THE LAST DECADE OF THE CENTURY IS ABOUT TO BEGIN, EL SALVADOR\nADDS ANOTHER PAGE TO THE BOOK OF LAST-MINUTE SURPRISES.  ALFREDO CRISTIANI\nHIMSELF--WHO, TOGETHER WITH ARMED FORCES OFFICERS, SAID HOURS AFTER THE\nJESUITS AND THEIR MAIDS HAD BEEN MURDERED THAT THERE WERE SUSPICIONS THAT\nTHE FMLN COULD BE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE--HAS JUST ACCEPTED, ESPECIALLY\nFOR THE BENEFIT OF THE U.S. CONGRESS, THAT ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL WERE THE\nONES WHO MURDERED THE TOP BRAINS, THE BEST INTELLECTUALS OF EL SALVADOR.\nTHE MURDERERS WERE MILITARY PERSONNEL, AND, AT LEAST ON THE NATIONAL\nTELEVISON NETWORK, CRISTIANI PROMISED TO DISLOSE THEIR NAMES.  [PASSAGE\nINDISTINCT]...THE JESUITS' MURDERS OR THE CANCELLATION OF AID.\n\n   IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE ARMY--WHICH MURDERED MONSIGNO OSCAR ROMERO, 1,000\nPEASANTS IN EL MOZOTE, 70 INDIANS IN LAS HOJAS, HUNDREDS OF SALVADORANS IN\nZUNPU, AND UNIONISTS AT THE FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION\nFEDERATION] OFFICES, ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE ARMED FORCES' WELL-KNOWN\nCRIMES--IS GOING TO BE PURGED AT LAST, IF THIS IS REALLY TRUE, THEN WE WOULD\nHAVE TO SAY THAT A TRUE NEGOTIATION WILL START.  IN THE PAST, THE FMLN HAS\nMADE PROPOSALS FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO END THE WAR.  \n\n   ONE OF OUR DEMANDS, A REALISTIC DEMAND TO PROPITIATE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR,\nIS UNDOUBTEDLY THE PURGE OF THE ARMY.  IN MEXCIO AND IN SAN JOSE, COSTA\nRICA, WE SAID THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT ACCEPT THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL, THE\nNATION WOULD DO SO.  AND THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  THE NATION DEMANDS THAT\nTHE ARMED FORCES BE PURGED.\n\n   THE MOST IMPORTANT U.S. NEWSPAPERS AND NEWSCASTS HAVE NOTED THE\nIRREFUTABLE FACT THAT 10 YEARS OF U.S. ADVICE AND AN INVESTMENT OF MORE THAN\n$3 BILLION--VERY CLOSE TO $4 BILLION--TO CREATE A HUGE BUILDUP IN THEIR\nARMAMENTS HAVE NOT SERVED TO CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF AN ARMY THAT MURDERED\nMONSIGNOR ROMERO AND THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS, INCLUDING NUNS AND U.S.\nADVISERS.  WE BELIEVE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR CHRISTOPHER DODD WAS MISTAKEN WHEN\nHE SAID THAT U.S. AID IN ITSELF WAS NOT BEING DISCUSSED.  THE 10 YEARS OF\nAID, ADVICE, AND U.S. STRATEGY IN EL SALVADOR HAVE PROVEN TO BE A FAILURE.\nIF THE UNITED STATES HAS ANY INTENTIONS OF CONTRIBUTING TO PEACE, NOW IS THE\nTIME TO CHANGE ITS POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR.\n\n   EVENTS HAVE PLACED THE ISSUE OF THE CONTINUATION OF AID TO EL SALVADOR ON\nTHE CONGRESSMEN'S WORKTABLES.  THE AID WAS MADE CONDITIONAL ON PUNISHMENT\nFOR THE JESUITS' MURDERS.  BUT WHAT IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY?  IT IS A\nDECISION THAT GOES BEYOND A BASIC DEMAND FOR JUSTICE.  IT WILL DETERMINE THE\nCONTINUATION OF U.S. AID.  IT ENTAILS THE DECISION TO TURN THEIR POLICY\nAROUND TO CONTRIBUTE TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR.  THEY ARE TO\nDISCUSS WHETHER CONGRESS' POSITION IS TO BE: ONE, WE APPROVE THE PURGE OF\nTHE ARMY AND THUS WE WILL GIVE THEM MORE AID, OR, TWO, WE APPROVE THE PURGE\nAS A CONCRETE STEP TO DEMOCRATIZATION AND WILL SUSPEND MILITARY AID SO THAT\nTHESE CONDITIONS CAN BE USED TO REACH A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION.\n\n   WILL U.S. CONGRESSMEN BE CAPABLE OF SURPRISING THE WORLD BY HELPING THE\nSALVADORANS TO TOPPLE THE FASCIST WALL, THE WALL OF WAR?  WILL THEY DO THIS\nBY STOPPING MILITARY AID?  THE FMLN HAS SAID CLEARLY THAT IF THE UNITED\nSTATES STOPS AID TO THE ARMY IT WILL CORRESPOND WITH ACTIONS TO REACH A\nCOMPLETE HALT IN HOSTILITIES.  WE HOPE THE U.S. CONGRESS DOES NOT MAKE A\nMISTAKE.  IF IT STOPS AID, IF IT CUTS IT, IF IT ENDS IT, WE WILL STAND\nBEFORE A CLEAR AND HOPEFUL SIGN FOR PEACE.  HOWEVER, IF NOT, WE WILL STAND\nBEFORE YET ANOTHER SIGN OF WAR, AND THE SURPRISE WILL NOT BE A GOOD ONE.",

      "text": "   CLANDESTINE, 8 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATION COMMENTARY]\n[TEXT] GOODBYE [AIR FORCE COMMANDER] GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, FALSE\nHOPE FOR MASS KILLERS.  GEN.  BUSTILLO RESIGNS OR IS MADE TO RESIGN AS\nTHE AIR FORCE CHIEF.  BECAUSE OF THIS, THE GENERAL IS ADMITTING THAT\nWITHOUT THE BOMBING ON SAN SALVADOR'S NEIGHBORHOODS THE FMLN\n[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WOULD HAVE DEFEATED THE\nSALVADORAN ARMED FORCES.  BUSTILLO'S RESIGNATION IS YET ANOTHER SIGN\nOF THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF THE U.S. COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY IN EL\nSALVADOR, AS BECAME CLEAR WITH THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON 10 NOVEMBER.\n\n   FOR 10 YEARS THE MILITARY AND THEIR U.S. SPONSORS BASED THEIR TRUST IN THE\nAIR POWER TO DROWN IN BLOOD THE ASPIRATION OF THE NATION TO ACHIEVE\nDEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.  THIS FIRST HAPPENED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE\nCOUNTRY, WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF DOZENS OF TOWNS LIKE TENANCINGO, BERLIN,\nTOROLA, SAN FERNANDO, AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT TOOK PLACE ALONG WITH THE\nGENOCIDE CARRIED OUT BY THE INFANTRY WITH THE MASS MURDERS OF CIVILIANS IN\nEL MOSOTO, SUNPUL, AND OCOTAPAYO.  BUSTILLO IS LEAVING AS SO MANY GENERALS\nAND U.S. AMBASSADORS HAVE.  AND LIKE ALL OF THEM HIS DEPARTURE REVEALS THE\nIMPERIALIST POWER'S FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE ITS COUNTERINSURGENCY PROGRAM IN\nEL SALVADOR.\n\n   AS ALL THE OTHERS WHO HAVE LEFT, BUSTILLO ALSO SEEKS EXCUSES IN THE FACE\nOF HIS FAILURE, BY ACCUSING OTHERS.  HE ACCUSES [FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER\nEUGENIO] VIDES CASANOVA OF BEING SOFT IN FIGHTING THE PEOPLE'S PLAN.  ONE\nWOULD HAVE TO ASK BUSTILLO IF THE AIR FORCE, OF WHICH HE REPRESENTED ITS\nMOST ENCOURAGING PILLAR, WAS SOFT WHEN IT MURDERED 70,000 SALVADORANS,\nMONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDED, AND EVEN WHEN IT\nMURDERED PATRIOT OFFICERS OF THAT SAME ARMY.  WAS THE U.S. PENTAGON SOFT\nWHEN IT GAVE $3 BILLION, WEAPONS, AND BOMBS FOR THE MOST COWARDLY ACT OF\nGENOCIDE LATIN AMERICA CAN RECALL THIS CENTURY?\n\n   THE U.S. STRATEGY, IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE TOP MILITARY COMMAND IN THE\nPAST 10 YEARS WITH ALL ITS MIGHT DID ALL IT COULD SO THAT THE PERMANENT\nREBELLION IN THE RURAL AREAS REACHED THE COUNTRY'S VITAL CENTERS, AS INDEED\nHAPPENED AS OF THE 10 NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE.  BUSTILLO STATES IT CLEARLY.\n\n   THE BOMBING TEMPORARILY HALTED THE DEFEAT OF THE TOP COMMAND.  THROUGH AN\nACT OF GENOCIDE, IT MANAGED TO REMOVE THE DISGRUNTLED PEOPLE FROM THE\nNEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE GUERRILLA FORCES WERE.  BUSTILLO ACKNOWLEDGES\nGENOCIDE IS THE SOLE WAY THE ARMED FORCES CAN SURVIVE.  BUSTILLO\nACKNOWLEDGES THE FMLN'S STRENGTH AND THEREFORE URGES THE ARMED FORCES TO BE\nTOUGHER AND INFLEXIBLE AND REJECTS A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.  A\nPOLITICAL SOLUTION WOULD EXPRESS THE CONSENSUS AMONG THE COUNTRY'S MAJOR\nSECTORS.  OBVIOUSLY THE TOP COMMAND REPRESENTS A DECADENT MINORITY.\nBUSTILLO SUPPORTS LAUNCHING A FASCIST CRUSADE AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S WISH FOR\nDEMOCRACY.  IN THIS EFFORT, HE LASHES OUT AT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, ALL\nOPPOSITION SECTORS THAT REPORT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, AND ALL SECTORS THAT\nSUPPORT DEMOCRATIZING THE COUNTRY.  IN CONCLUSION, WE SAY THAT BUSTILLO IS\nNOT RESIGNING OF HIS OWN VOLITION.  THE FMLN ACTION ELIMINATED BUSTILLO AS\nIT ELIMINATED GARCIA, VIDES, AND SO MANY OTHER MILITARY CHIEFS WHO LEFT\nTHEIR POSTS WITHOUT FULFILLING THE TASK COMMISSIONED BY THE UNITED STATES:\nTO STOP THE FMLN.\n\n   THE FMLN OFFENSIVE BARED THE GENOCIDAL, ANTIPOPULAR, AND FASCIST NATURE OF\nTHE ALFREDO CRISTIANI REGIME TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT PROMPTED A STRONG\nDEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES ON CUTTING MILITARY AID.  THE JESUITS' MURDERS\nAND THE BOMBINGS SO SHOOK THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT IT IS PRESSURING\nFOR PUNISHMENT OF THE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THESE INCIDENTS.  HOWEVER, THE\nBUSH ADMINISTRATION ACCEPTED THIS, SINCE COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE [CHAIRMAN\nOF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF] AND HIS CLIQUE, EVEN CRISTIANI, MUST SHOULDER\nTHIS RESPONSIBILITY.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT IN COSTA RICA THE SALVADORAN\nDEFENSE MINISTER DISCLOSED CRISTIANI AUTHORIZED THE BOMBINGS.\n\n   BUSH NEEDED A SCAPEGOAT TO PLACE IT ON THE ALTAR OF THE DEBATES WHICH WILL\nBEGIN IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON THE FATE OF MILITARY AID.  BUSTILLO IS BUSH'S\nSCAPEGOAT.  HOWEVER, BUSTILLO WAS ALREADY A USELESS ELEMENT OF THE MURDEROUS\nMACHINERY THAT REMAINS ACTIVE.  WILL THE U.S. PUBLIC AND CONGRESS BE\nAPPEASED WITH THIS FOUL TASTING CANDY?  TIME AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES ARE\nOBVIOUSLY RUNNING AGAINST THE FASCIST PROGRAM IN EL SALVADOR.  WHILE PEOPLES\nOF THE WORLD TEAR DOWN DOGMAS, DICTATORSHIPS, AND WALLS, BUSTILLO, WHO\nLEAVES THROUGH THE DOOR OF DEFEAT, ASKS THE ARMED FORCES TO BE TOUGHER,\nCOMMIT MORE GENOCIDE, AND BUILD MORE WALLS OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH,\nTHE PEOPLE, AND THE NATION AS A WHOLE.  GOODBYE, GEN. BUSTILLO.  WE CONTINUE\nWRITING HISTORY WITHOUT YOU.  THE DECADE WE BEGIN IS OF DEMOCRACY,\nINDEPENDENCE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.  THAT IS WHY FOREIGN INTERVENTION AND\nTHE WALLS OF INTOLERANCE HAVE A SHORT LIFE SPAN IN THIS COUNTRY, WHERE THE\nPEOPLE GROW IN HEROISM AND THE STRUGGLE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE IS NOT DETERRED BY\nBOMBINGS.",

THE\nREPORT SAYS THAT SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS ARE\nSTILL UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION\nFRONT [FMLN].  ARMED FORCES OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT SOME\nAREAS OF SAN SALVADOR ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN.  THE REPORT ADDS\nTHAT AS OF 2140 ON 12 NOVEMBER, THERE WAS STILL TENSION IN THE CITY.\n\n   SOME SPORADIC SHOOTING WAS STILL HEARD, AND THE SITUATION IN\nVARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL CITY INDICATED THAT OUR COMRADES ARE\nMAINTAINING THEIR POSITIONS, THEY ARE CARRYING OUT MILITARY\nENGINEERING TASKS, OPENING TRENCHES, AND SETTING UP BARRICADES WITH\nTHE COOPERATION OF THE SAN SALVADOR PEOPLE.\n\n   PRESS AGENCY REPORTS NOTE THAT THERE IS GREAT TENSION IN THE\nCAPITAL CITY, AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE EXPECTING [CHANGES THOUGHT] HERE\nIS A NEWS AGENCY REPORT WHICH SAYS THAT EARLY THIS MORNING, LESS\nSHOOTING WAS HEARD BECAUSE APPARENTLY EACH SIDE HAD CONSOLIDATED THEIR\nPOSITION.  THAT IS WHAT SOME PRESS AGENCIES ARE REPORTING.\n\n   WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT\nSOME AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN.  THERE ARE\nMANY VEHICLES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR.  THAT IS\nTHE REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR, WHERE OUR FIGHTERS IN\nZACAMIL AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN THE CAPITAL\nCITY ARE NOW RECEIVING THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FORTIFYING\nTHEMSELVES IN NEIGHBORHOODS.\n\n   WE CALL ON THE SAN SALVADORAN YOUTHS TO GO OUT TONIGHT TO COOPERATE\nWITH THE FMLN FIGHTERS.  MAKE THE ASSASSINS OF MSGR ROMERO PAY DEARLY\nFOR EVERY STEP THEY TAKE AGAINST THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN\nSAN SALVADOR CITY.  IT HAS BEEN 24, 25, NEARLY 26 HOURS SINCE THE FMLN\nFIGHTERS ESTABLISHED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR IN VIEW OF THE\nREGIME'S INCOMPETENCE.  THE REGIME HAS CLEARLY SAID THAT IT IS\nINCAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, AS IT HAS HAD TO DECREE A\nSTATE OF SIEGE THAT BEGAN ON THE EVENING OF 12 NOVEMBER IN SAN\nSALVADOR.\n\n   ANOTHER EVIDENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S WEAKNESS IS THE GAG PLACED ON\nTHE MEDIA.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ALLOWED THE MEDIA TO BROADCAST ITS\nNEWSCASTS.  WHY DOESN'T THE GOVERNMENT WANT THE PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO\nNEWSCASTS IN EL SALVADOR?  WHAT IS THE CRISTIANI REGIME HIDING?  THIS\nIS A QUESTION THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING; THEY WANT TO KNOW THE\nANSWER.  THE GOVERNMENT IS AFRAID, IT DOES NOT WANT TO INFORM THE\nPEOPLE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS OR THE SCOPE OF THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT\nBY THE FMLN THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.\n\n   COMRADE FIGHTERS: WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU; THIS IS IN THE BAG.\nYOUR COURAGE AND DETERMINATION TO WIN HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY\nOUT THE FMLN PLAN AS OUR COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS\nSAID.\n\n   COMRADES: KEEP IT UP, KEEP AN OPEN EYE, KEEP UP THE HIGH MORALE AS\nYOU HAVE DONE UP TO NOW, SEEK CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE, RECEIVE THEIR\nCOOPERATION IN THE FORTIFICATIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE THROUGHOUT SAN\nSALVADOR.

SOME\nGROUPS, HOWEVER, ASSERT THAT CASOLO WAS RELEASED DUE TO POLITICAL\nPRESSURE FROM THE UNITED STATES, WHICH THREATENED TO LAUNCH A\nWORLDWIDE CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT EL SALVADOR IF CASOLO WAS NOT\nRELEASED.\n\n   AGUILAR MARROQUIN WAS ARRESTED AT 1500 ON 9 DECEMBER AFTER HAVING\nPARTICIPATED IN AN ATTACK ON AN URBAN PUBLIC BUS NEAR JUAN PABLO II\nBOULEVARD.\n\n   THE WOMAN FLED AND SOUGHT REFUGE INSIDE THE FACILITIES OF THE\nSALVADORAN ALBERTO MASFERRER UNIVERSITY, WHERE SHE TOOK A GROUP OF\nSTUDENTS AS HOSTAGES, THREATENING THEM WITH HAND GRENADES. THE POLICE\nPREVENTED HER FROM DOING ANYTHING AND ARRESTED HER, CONFISCATING ONE\n.45-CALIBER PISTOL, BULLETS, CARTRIDGES, AND TWO FRAGMENTATION\nGRENADES.\n\n   AGUILAR MARROQUIN SAID THAT SHE JOINED THE ERP LAST MARCH AND THAT\nSHE WAS PART OF AN URBAN COMMANDO CALLED WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND.\nAGUILAR ADDED THAT SHE KNOWS U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO, WHO BELONGS\nTO THE ERP, AND THAT CASOLO USED TO MEET WITH TERRORIST LEADER\nFERNANDO, WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND OPERATIONS CHIEF, NEAR THE NATIONAL\nUNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY (UES).\n\n   AGUILAR ADDED THAT CASOLO WAS IN CHARGE OF ERP LOGISTICS,\nESPECIALLY LODGING PEOPLE AND TRANSPORTING ARMS AND WAR EQUIPMENT.\nTHE ERP HAD GIVEN HER TWO MINIBUSES FOR HER TO CARRY OUT HER TASKS.\n\n   IN ADDITION, AGUILAR SAID THAT SHE BELIEVES CASOLO HAD A LEADING\nPOSITION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION, BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO MEETING WITH\nFERNANDO, SHE ALSO MET WITH AN INDIVIDUAL KNOWN AS MINCHO, WHO IS THE\nPOLITICAL-MILITARY ERP METROPOLITAN CHIEF AND ALSO THE CHIEF OF THE\nSO-CALLED URBAN COMMANDOS.\n\n   THE PRISONER KNEW ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE ARMS IN CASOLO'S\nHOUSE, BECAUSE ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS AGUILAR'S CHIEF, KNOWN AS MIRIAM,\nTOLD HER ABOUT IT.

      "text": "   SANTIAGO, 14 MAR 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] AGRICULTURE\nMINISTER JAIME DE LA SOTTA AND FOREIGN MINISTER HERNAN FELIPE\nERRAZURIZ WILL LEAVE TONIGHT FOR THE UNITED STATES IN AN ATTEMPT TO\nACHIEVE THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON IMPORTED CHILEAN FRUITS.  THEY WILL\nTAKE LAN-CHILE FLIGHT 141 THAT DEPARTS AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 FROM\nSANTIAGO AND GOES DIRECTLY TO NEW YORK.\n\n   IN NEW YORK, THE TWO MINISTERS WILL TAKE ANOTHER PLANE TO WASHINGTON AND\nWILL ARRIVE AT APPROXIMATELY NOON TOMORROW. IN THE U.S. CAPITAL THEY WILL\nMEET WITH OFFICIALS OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.\n\n   THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE TRIP IS TO ACHIEVE THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON\nIMPORTED CHILEAN FRUITS.  U.S. OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THE BAN OVER AN UNUSUAL\nTELEVISION NETWORK FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY THAT SOME CHILEAN GRAPES WERE\nLACED CYANIDE.  DE LA SOTTA STATED THAT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE DAMAGE\nTHAT TERRORISM CAN CAUSE.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DE LA SOTTA] YOU CAN SEE AND MEASURE THE SCOPE OF A\nTERRORIST ACT SUCH AS THE ONE WE HAVE JUST EXPERIENCED, THE SOLE OBJECTIVE\nOF WHICH IS TO CAUSE HARM. THIS CAN BE DEMONSTRATED BY THE ADVERTISEMENT,\nNOT A CLEAR AND CONCRETE ADVERTISEMENT, BUT AN ANONYMOUS TELEPHONE CALL BY\nWHICH THEY WARNED US, THAT IS, THEY WARNED THE EMBASSIES THEY CALLED, THAT\nTHEY WOULD CARRY OUT SUCH AN ACT.  THIS CALL WAS MADE 3 DAYS AFTER THE\nDEPARTURE OF THE FRUIT SHIPMENT.  WE ATTEMPTED TO CONTROL THE SITUATION TO\nTHE EXTENT POSSIBLE, FOLLOWING TECHNICAL PROCEDURES CONCERNING THE AMOUNT OF\nSAMPLES TAKEN.  THEN WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE SITUATION WAS UNDER CONTROL, THAT\nIT WAS AN ANOMYOUS CALL AND AS SUCH COULD NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  LATER, IN\nTHE SHIPMENTS THAT ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES LAST WEEKEND, THE PRESENCE\nOF CYANIDE WAS DETECTED IN TWO GRAPES.  [END RECORDING]\n\n   DE LA SOTTA ADDED THAT ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO OVERCOME THE\nIMPASSE.  THE MAJOR PROBLEM NOW INVOLVES THE 17 MILLION BOXES THAT ARRIVED\nAT THEIR PORTS OF DESTINATION READY FOR DISTRIBUTION.  NOW NO ONE KNOWS WHAT\nTO DO WITH THEM.  THERE ARE 7 OR 8 MILLION BOXES MORE BEING SHIPPED TO THE\nSAME PORTS, AND 3 MILLION BOXES REMAIN IN THE COUNTRY, READY TO BE SHIPPED.\nDE LA SOTTA SAID THAT THE CYANIDE WAS FOUND IN TWO SINGLE GRAPES.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [DE LA SOTTA] THE ESSENTIAL THING, I BELIEVE, IS [WORDS\nINDISTINCT] THAT THE UNITED STATES CAN ADOPT MEASURES.  WE WILL TALK WITH\nTHE HEALTH OFFICIALS TO GIVE THEM THE NECESSARY ASSURANCES SO THEY CAN LIFT\nTHE BAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  [END RECORDING]\n\n   IN ORDER TO FACE THE PROBLEM, THE GOVERNMENT HAS CREATED THREE COMISSIONS\nTO STUDY THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM, THE AGRICULTURE MINISTER\nSTATED.",

GOD ALMIGHTY\nAND MY CONSCIENCE KNOW I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT REPUDIATED MURDER.\n\n   \"EVERY TIME THERE ARE ELECTIONS, WE HEAR THE SAME RUMORS THAT THERE IS\nEVIDENCE ABOUT MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S CASE AND THAT IT WILL BE\nPRESENTED.  THUS, A GREAT SHOW IS PRESENTED, BUT ONCE THE ELECTIONS ARE\nOVER NO ONE REMEMBERS THAT MARTYR OF THE CHURCH.\n\n   \"DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT, SUPPORTED BY THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY, PDC,\nRESORTS TO VILE DEFAMATION, SLANDER, AND LIES AGAINST ITS POLITICAL\nOPPONENTS BECAUSE IT CANNOT HIDE ITS CORRUPTION.\"\n\n   THIS STATEMENT WAS ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE, ARENA,\nDEPUTY TO REJECT THE ANNOUNCEMENT ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT, \"IN A NATIONAL\nRADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK,\" THAT IMPLICATED D'AUBUISSON \"IN MSGR OSCAR\nARNULFO ROMERO'S DEATH.\"\n\n   \"I AM SORRY I DID NOT SEE THE BROADCAST, BUT OTHERS HAVE COMMENTED ON\nIT.  I CAN VERY WELL IMAGINE ALL THE DESPICABLE THINGS THAT WERE\nIRRESPONSIBLY SAID TO TWIST THE TRUTH SO THE PDC COULD AGAIN USE MSGR\nROMERO'S DEATH AS AN ELECTION ISSUE.  IT IS ALL PART OF THE PDC'S\nPROPAGANDA, BUT THE TRUTH WILL ALWAYS PREVAIL,\" D'AUBUISSON SAID.\n\n   \"THE MOST REPREHENSIBLE THING IS THAT THE DUARTE ADMINISTRATION USES\nRADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS, OPENLY ABUSING ITS AUTHORITY, TO SLANDER\nME--SIMPLY BECAUSE I AM THE PDC'S POLITICAL ADVERSARY, AND BECAUSE THE PDC\nHAS NO EXCUSE TO JUSTIFY THE CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN CAUSED BY ITS\nCORRUPTION.\"\n\n   D'AUBUISSON ADDED:  THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS' \"LIE\" IS AIMED AT\nDECEIVING SALVADORAN CATHOLICS.  THAT IS DESPICABLE AND UNSPEAKABLE,\nBECAUSE THEY ARE INSULTING MSGR ROMERO'S MEMORY.\n\n   THE PDC HAS GOVERNED THE COUNTRY FOR 8 YEARS.  THE PDC CONTROLLED THE\nATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHEN MSGR ROMERO WAS KILLED.  THE CRUCIAL\nQUESTION IS:  WHY WEREN'T THE NECESSARY MEASURES TAKEN TO CLARIFY THE CASE\nAT THE TIME?  WHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT CLAIM IT HAS THE EVIDENCE YET FAILS\nTO PRESENT IT?  AH, BECAUSE THIS WOULD END THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL GAME\nOF SAYING THAT IT IS INVESTIGATING MSGR ROMERO'S DEATH!  THIS ENTIRE\nATTITUDE IS REPREHENSIBLE, D'AUBUISSON STATED.\n\n   HE ASSERTED:  I AM AWARE OF THE PDC'S INCREDIBLE PLOT TO SLANDER ME,\nBUT THE PDC ONLY SAYS WHAT IS CONVENIENT.  IT IS A DIRTY GAME BUT GOD IS\nMY WITNESS; MY CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE KNOW MY GREAT\nCRIME HAS BEEN TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE MARXIST-LENINISTS.  THE PDC CANNOT\nFORGIVE ME FOR THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSELY LINKED WITH THOSE WHO \"ARE\nGREEN ON THE OUTSIDE [REFERENCE TO THE PDC'S PARTY COLORS] BUT RED ON THE\nINSIDE.\"  HOWEVER, I WILL CONTINUE STRUGGLING LIKE A GOOD SALVADORAN SO THE\n\"TURNCOATS\" DO NOT BETRAY US, AS WAS THE CASE IN NICARAGUA, MAJOR ROBERTO\nD'AUBUISSON ARRIETA EMPHASIZED.",

      "text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 6 FEB 89 -- [TEXT] JUSTICE MINISTER JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA\nSAID TODAY ALL THE EVIDENCE GATHERED BY THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS\nCOMMISSION DEMONSTRATES THAT DR ANTONIO REGALADO WAS THE PERPETRATOR OF\nTHE MURDER OF MSGR ROMERO.\n\n   IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMISSION,\nDR JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA REPORTED TODAY IN DETAIL ON THE MURDER OF MSGR\nOSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO.  DR SAMAYOA SAID TO CLARIFY THE CASE, THE COMMISSION\nHAS CONDUCTED 238 MEETINGS, OVER 100 INQUIRIES, AND 21 DEPOSITIONS.  HE\nADDED THAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE NAME OF \"OPERATION\nPINEAPPLE\" AND THAT IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON WAS THE\nMASTERMIND AND DR ANTONIO REGALADO WAS THE PERPETRATOR.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SAMAYOA] THERE IS NO DOUBT.  ALL THE INVESTIGATIONS\nCARRIED OUT BY THE COMMISSION POINT TO MAJ ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON AS THE\nMASTERMIND.  THIS HAS TO BE PROVEN IN COURT.  HOWEVER, HE HAS PARLIAMENTARY\nIMMUNITY; HE CANNOT BE BROUGHT TO COURT.  THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN\nALLIANCE [ARENA] HAS THE MAJORITY IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND ARENA IS\nNOT GOING TO PERMIT A DECLARATION THAT WILL BRING HIS CASE TO COURT. [END\nRECORDING]\n\n   DR SAMAYOA ALSO SAID HE IS WILLING TO PRESENT ALL THE EVIDENCE HE HAS\nON THE CASE.  HOWEVER, HE SAID HE DID NOT TRUST THE BEHAVIOR OF THE\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE REPUBLIC:\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SAMAYOA] WE WILL PRESENT THE EVIDENCE.  I THINK THEY\nARE GOING TO BE SORRY THEY MADE THAT REQUEST, BECAUSE MANY PERSONS ARE\nINVOLVED.  SINCE THEIR PARTICIPATION HAS NOT YET BEEN PROVEN, THESE NAMES\nHAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED.  HOWEVER, WHEN WE PRESENT THE ENTIRE DOSSIER TO\nTHE COURTS, THESE NAMES ARE GOING TO COME UP.  THEN SOME WILL JUDGE AND\nDECIDE IF THEY PARTICIPATED OR NOT.  BUT THEIR NAMES ARE THERE, AS ARE\nTHEIR ACTIVITIES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS TO THE DEATH SQUADS.  MANY\nPERSONS WHO ARE MENTIONED ARE APPARENTLY RESPECTABLE, AND I MEAN\nRESPECTABLE IN QUOTES.  [END RECORDING]\n\n   THE ASSASSINATION OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO TOOK PLACE ON 24 MARCH\n1980; ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL, THE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE TAKEN 9 YEARS\nBECAUSE MANY PERSONS CONSIDERED KEY WITNESSES HAVE DIED SINCE THE TIME OF\nTHE MURDER.  HOWEVER, HE ADDED, WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE FBI AS WELL AS\nSOME CENTRAL AMERICAN INVESTIGATION ORGANIZATIONS, THE CASE HAS BEEN\nCLARIFIED, WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO THE IMPRISONMENT OF MAJ D'AUBUISSON ONCE HE\nLOSES HIS PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY.",

DURING THIS ATTACK, THE TERRORISTS SET MOST OF THE CITY'S\nPUBLIC BUILDINGS ON FIRE.  THEY FAILED, HOWEVER, TO BRING LOCAL GOVERNMENT\nOFFICIALS BEFORE THEIR \"KANGAROO COURT\" BECAUSE THE OFFICIALS WERE ALERTED\nAND FLED BEFORE THE TERRORISTS ARRIVED.\n\n   POLICE AUTHORITIES REPORTED TODAY IN LIMA THAT YESTERDAY HEAVILY-ARMED\nSHINING PATH TERRORISTS OVERPOWERED ANDAHUA RESIDENTS AND BURNED THE\nOFFICES OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTERPRISE, THE AGRARIAN BANK, THE\nNATIONAL BANK, AND HEALTH MINISTRY OFFICES.  ALTHOUGH THE BUILDINGS WERE\nBURNED TO THE GROUND, NO ONE WAS INJURED.\n\n   THE TERRORISTS ATTEMPTED TO BRING THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES BEFORE A\nKANGAROO COURT TO IMPLEMENT WHAT THEY CALL \"PEOPLE'S JUSTICE,\"  THE PUBLIC\nEXECUTION OF THESE AUTHORITIES IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PEOPLE.  THE LOCAL\nAUTHORITIES, HOWEVER, HAD ALREADY FLED.\n\n   BEFORE LEAVING THE CITY, THE TERRORISTS BLOCKED AND DESTROYED SEVERAL\nSEGMENTS OF THE ROAD LINKING ANDAHUA WITH AREQUIPA AND OTHER ADJACENT TOWNS\nIN ORDER TO PREVENT LOCAL RESIDENTS FROM FOLLOWING THEM.",

      "text": "   TEGUCIGALPA, 26 JAN 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA BY JULIO\nARMANDO VALDES] [EXCERPT] [AZCONA] ...WHICH HAS DISMAYED ALL HONDURAN\nPEOPLE.  THE GOVERNMENT STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS KIND OF ACTION--THE MURDER\nOF [RETIRED] GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ MARTINEZ--WHICH WAS POLITICALLY\nMOTIVATED AND PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS, AND WHICH, I BELIEVE, DESERVES\nTHE DENUNCIATION OF ALL HONDURANS.\n\n   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WILL THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE\nARMED FORCES ADOPT ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES?\n\n   [AZCONA] YES, WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THAT SOON.  I HAVE A MEETING\nSCHEDULED WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH WILL ALSO BE\nATTENDED BY THE THREE PRESIDENTS OF THE STATE BRANCHES.  I MEAN, THE\n[WORDS INDISTINCT] WILL CHAIR THE MEETING, AND NATIONAL CONGRESS\nPRESIDENT CARLOS ARBIN MONTOYA AND SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT SALOMON\nJIMENEZ CASTRO WILL ALSO ATTEND.  WE HAVE ALSO INVITED THE CANDIDATES\nOF THE TWO [NUMBER AS HEARD] PARTIES TO THIS MEETING SINCE ONE OF THEM\nIS GOING TO BE THE NEXT HONDURAN PRESIDENT.  WE PLAN TO ESTABLISH SOME\nGUIDELINE--SOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED--NOT JUST FOR THE REMAINDER OF\nOUR TERM BUT IN THE FUTURE AS WELL, BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE FARSIGHTED\nAND NOT JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE SHORT TERM, WHICH HAS BEEN VERY COMMON\nIN HONDURAS, WHERE WE LOOK AND FIND SOLUTIONS ONLY FOR THE PRESENT.\nWE SHOULD FIND SOLUTIONS JOINTLY [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN THE LONG RUN,\nWHICH INCLUDES THE ISSUE OF VIOLENCE.  WE BELIEVE IN A DEMOCRACY LIKE\nOURS, WHICH IS A VERY COMPLETE DEMOCRACY.  IN OTHER WORDS, THERE ARE\nINTERNAL ELECTIONS FOR SELECTING CANDIDATES, WHERE CITIZENS ENJOY FULL\nRIGHTS, WHERE PARTIES AND PARTY LEADERS CONSULT WITH THE PEOPLE, WHERE\nWE HAVE TRUE, CLEAN, AND HONEST ELECTIONS, WHERE WE HAVE A NATIONAL\nELECTORAL COMMISSION THAT IS NOT INFLUENCED BY NOR CAN IT BE\nINFLUENCED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND WHERE THE STATE BRANCHES ARE TOTALLY\nINDEPENDENT.\n\n   ALL OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAKE HONDURAS A DEMOCRACY, AND EVERY\nSECTOR OF HONDURAN SOCIETY SHOULD STRIVE TO STRENGTHEN THEM BY AVOIDING\nVIOLENCE AT ALL COSTS, OBEYING THE LAW, AND CONDEMNING AND ATTACKING\nEXTREME TERRORIST GROUPS REGARDLESS OF THEIR AFFILIATION, THUS ENABLING US\nTO CONSOLIDATE OUR DEMOCRACY AND REACH THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT\nATTAINED BY OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.\n\n   IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WORLDWIDE THAT PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT CAN\nONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DEMOCRACY.  THE FRG, THE MEDITERRANEAN\nCOUNTRIES--ITALY, FRANCE, AND SPAIN--ARE EXAMPLES OF THIS, AND THERE IS\nTHE CASE OF JAPAN, WHICH HAS A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AND HAS ACHIEVED\nEXTRAORDINARY LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT.  TAIWAN IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE.  AT\nTHIS STAGE...\n\n   [VALDES, INTERRUPTING] YES, BUT THIS TAKES TIME.\n\n   [AZCONA] YES.  AT THIS STAGE I BELIEVE THERE IS SUFFICIENT PROOF THAT\nTHE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IS THE BEST MEANS OF ATTAINING HIGHER LEVELS OF\nDEVELOPMENT.  THERE IS NO DOUBT IN ANYONE'S MIND ABOUT THAT, BUT THE FACT\nTHAT WE HAVE THIS SYSTEM IS NOT ENOUGH.  EACH ONE OF US, EACH SECTOR, MUST\nDO HIS PART TO MAKE IT WORK.\n\n   WHEN I MENTION SECTORS, I AM REFERRING TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, WHICH\nMUST BE GENEROUS, EXHIBIT CONFIDENCE IN THE COUNTRY, AND SHOW MUCH\nINITIATIVE; TO ORGANIZED LABOR GROUPS, WHICH MUST FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS\nWITHOUT FOMENTING STRIKES AND OTHER DISORDERS, WHICH ARE SOMETIMES BROUGHT\nABOUT ILLEGALLY INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE NORMAL LEGAL PROCEDURES; TO\nPROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAVE AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY,\nBECAUSE THEIR MEMBERS MUST COMPLY WITH THEIR DUTIES; AND THE SAME GOES FOR\nGOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS.\n\n   IN OTHER WORDS, THIS WILL NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS OR THE NEXT\nGOVERNMENT ALONE.  OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE TRANSITORY AND THEIR POWER IS\nRELATIVE.  I HAVE SAID THIS MANY TIMES.  THERE IS NO POINT IN LASHING OUT\nAT THE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE POWER IN HONDURAS IS RELATIVE AND CONDITIONAL.\nWHAT IS ESSENTIAL IS TO CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TOWARD HONDURAS'\nDEVELOPMENT.  THIS SHOULD BE A RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY OF PUBLIC\nEMPLOYEES, BUSINESSMEN, WORKERS, AND ORGANIZED PEASANTS, BUT ALL HONDURANS\nSHOULD CONTRIBUTE.  THAT IS WHAT COUNTS.\n\n   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, WHEN WILL THIS MEETING BE HELD AND WHAT IMMEDIATE\nMEASURES WILL YOU PROPOSE?\n\n   [AZCONA] THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO\nINVESTIGATE THE LATEST CRIME, WHICH WAS NOT AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE LIKE A\nROBBERY OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE.  THIS CRIME WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED.  IT\nWAS A TERRORIST ACT PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS.\n\n   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THE DEATH\nPENALTY MIGHT BE A WAY TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION.  WHAT DO YOU THINK\nABOUT THIS?\n\n   [AZCONA] I RECENTLY READ SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY IN A MEXICAN\nMAGAZINE.  THE DEATH PENALTY IS OPPOSED BY A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AND HAS\nBEEN ABOLISHED IN HONDURAS.  I DO NOT THINK THIS IS THE SOLUTION HERE\nBECAUSE THE DEATH PENALTY HAS NOT SOLVED THE CRIME PROBLEM ANYWHERE ELSE IN\nTHE WORLD.  FOR INSTANCE, THIS PENALTY EXISTS IN MANY U.S. STATES, BUT THIS\nHAS NOT DETERRED CRIMINALS FROM COMMITTING TERRIBLE CRIMES.  PEOPLE HAVE\nLOST CONTROL.  WHEN CRIMINALS HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEIR FELLOW MAN, NOT\nEVEN THE DEATH PENALTY CAN STOP THEM.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE CRIMES, SUCH AS\nDRUG TRAFFICKING, FOR WHICH NO BAIL SHOULD BE PERMITTED.  I THINK A BILL\nTHAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE SHOULD BE PASSED BY\nTHE CONGRESS.  OF COURSE, IT WILL BE APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT SO THOSE\nFOUND GUILTY OF THIS CRIME CANNOT BE BAILED OUT.  IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR THE\nAUTHORITIES TO ARREST A DRUG TRAFFICKER ONLY TO SEE HIM RELEASED ON BAIL\nBY A JUDGE WHO HAS NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO ABIDE BY THE LAW.\n\n   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, THE FAR RIGHTIST GROUP AAA [ANTICOMMUNIST ACTION\nALLIANCE], THROUGH A LOCAL RADIO STATION, WARNED THAT THEY WILL TAKE\nREVENGE ON MAJOR COMMUNIST LEADERS, SUCH AS JORGE ARTURO REINA, RAMON\nCUSTODIO, AND OTHERS.  WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS?\n\n   [AZCONA] I AM ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THIS TYPE OF REVENGE BECAUSE IT WOULD\nONLY LEAD TO ESCALATED CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN GROUPS.  I CONDEMN THIS\nATTITUDE IN VIEW OF THE REGRETTABLE MURDER OF GENERAL GUSTAVO ALVAREZ\nMARTINEZ.  AS FAR AS THE DEATH PENALTY GOES, IT WILL NOT BE A SOLUTION TO\nTHE CRIME PROBLEM.\n\n   [VALDES] MR PRESIDENT, CIVIC COMMITTEES HAVE TO BE ORGANIZED IN THE\nCOUNTRY.\n\n   [AZCONA] I AGREE, BUT THESE COMMITTEES SHOULD BE CONTROLLED BY THE\nAUTHORITIES.  A CIVIC COMMITTEE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES IS ONE THING, BUT IT\nIS QUITE ANOTHER THING TO SUE THESE COMMITTEES TO PERFORM DUTIES THAT ARE\nALREADY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n   [VALDES] WHEN WILL THE GOVERNMENT BRANCHES MEET?\n\n   [AZCONA] THEY WILL MEET WHEN I RETURN FROM CARACAS.",

      "text": "   CLANDESTINE, 13 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATION COMMENTARY]\n[TEXT] WHAT WE HAD PREDICTED HAS OCCURRED.  CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED THIS\nAFTERNOON THAT A COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, ONE SECOND LIEUTENANT, TWO\nSECOND SERGEANTS, AND TWO SOLDIERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE OF\nTHE JESUITS.\n\n   THE ACCUSATION AGAINST COLONEL BENAVIDES IS THE FOLLOWING: THAT THE\nMULTIPLE CRIME WAS COMMITTED IN THE SECTOR UNDER HIS COMMAND.  FROM THE\nLIEUTENANT ON DOWN, THE ACCUSATION IS THAT THEY DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE\nCRIME.  [WORDS INDISTINCT], AS CRISTIANI SAID, THAT IT WAS COL BENAVIDES,\nBUT IT WAS NOT COL BENAVIDES WHO ISSUED THE ORDER.  SO, THE QUESTION IS: WHO\nGAVE THE ORDER TO KILL THE JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS.  IN OUR VIEW, COL\nBENAVIDES WAS IMPLICATED SOLELY AS A MEANS OF PROPAGANDA AIMED AT THE U.S.\nCONGRESS.  IT IS CLEAR THAT COL BENAVIDES DID NOT GIVE THE ORDER.  HE\nPROBABLY DID NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE ACTION.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT\nWE KNOW ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND.  FIRST, HE IS NOT KNOWN TO HAVE CARRIED OUT\nACTS OF REPRESSION OR CORRUPTION.  OUR REPORT INDICATES THAT BENAVIDES HAS\n   MAINTAINED A POSITION IN FAVOR OF INSTITUTIONS AND OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS.\nHE WAS DESCRIBED AS AN ACTIVE, STUDIOUS AND NOT REPRESSIVE CADET, ONE OF THE\nFEW EXCEPTIONS IN LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1977 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE\nCAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY].  IN OTHER WORDS, FOR THE\nLA TANDONA, A GANG OF ASSASSINS, HE IS A PERFECT SCAPEGOAT.\n\n   THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUITS WAS NOT A PERSONAL DECISION.  IT WAS PART OF\nTHE ARMED FORCES' COUNTEROFFENSIVE ACTIONS DURING THE NOVEMBER BATTLES.  IT\nWAS A COLD-BLOODED, PREMEDITATED PLAN EXECUTED TO DECAPITATE THE PEOPLE'S\nMOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION.  LET US REMEMBER THE THREATS AGAINST\nFATHER ELLACURIA OVER THE NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK PRIOR TO THE\nASSASSINATION.  LET US REMEMBER THAT BETWEEN THE NIGHT OF 15 NOVEMBER AND\nEARLY MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, SEVERAL OFFICES OF LABOR UNIONS AND HOUSES OF\nOPPOSITION MEMBERS WERE ATTACKED.  LET US REMEMBER THAT AFTER THE MASSSACRE\nOF THE JESUITS, THE OFFICERS SHOUTED OVER LOUDSPEAKERS THAT THEY HAD KILLED\nELLACURIA AND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CONTINUE KILLING COMMUNISTS.  THE\nBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR WAS A WITNESS TO THIS.\n\n   IN OUR VIEW, THE ASSASSINS OF THE JESUITS WERE THOSE WHO APPEARED ON THE\nRADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK MAKING KNOWN THE RESULTS OF THE SO-CALLED HONOR\nCOMMISSION.  COL BENAVIDES WILL PROBABLY BE FREED IN A SHORT TIME AND BE\nAPPOINTED TO SOME POST ABROAD, OR HE MIGHT EXPERIENCE THE SAME FATE AS THAT\nOF CAPTAIN EDUARDO ALFONSO AVILA, WHO WENT IN AND OUT OF JAIL EACH TIME THAT\nMILITARY AID FOR EL SALVADOR WAS DISCUSSED IN THE U.S. CONGRESS.\n\n   HOWEVER, IN ANY CASE AND AS HAS ALWAYS OCCURRED, IT WILL BE THE\nLIEUTENANTS, THE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND THE SOLDIERS WHO CARRIED OUT\nAN ORDER WHO WILL PAY THE CONSEQUENCES.  WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN\nTHE CASES OF THE NUNS WHEN [WORDS INDISTINCT] A FEW SOLDIERS, THE MASSACRE\nOF SAN FRANCISCO, AND THE ASSASSINATION OF THE U.S. ADVISERS AND RODOLFO\nVIERA.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] ONCE AGAIN THE PEOPLE'S HOPES ARE FRUSTRATED, AS\nHAS HAPPENED IN SO MANY OTHER CASES.\n\n   THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS AGAIN CONFIRMS THAT TO, AS CRISTIANI\nSAID, GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS, WE HAVE TO OBTAIN DEMOCRACY, JUSTICE, AND\nSELF-DETERMINATION.",

      "text": "   CLANDESTINE, 13 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATION COMMENTARY]\n[TEXT] WHAT WE HAD PREDICTED HAS OCCURRED.  CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED THIS\nAFTERNOON THAT A COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, ONE SECOND LIEUTENANT, TWO\nSECOND SERGEANTS, AND TWO SOLDIERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE MASSACRE OF\nTHE JESUITS.\n\n   THE ACCUSATION AGAINST COLONEL BENAVIDES IS THE FOLLOWING: THAT THE\nMULTIPLE CRIME WAS COMMITTED IN THE SECTOR UNDER HIS COMMAND.  FROM THE\nLIEUTENANT ON DOWN, THE ACCUSATION IS THAT THEY DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE\nCRIME.  [WORDS INDISTINCT], AS CRISTIANI SAID, THAT IT WAS COL BENAVIDES,\nBUT IT WAS NOT COL BENAVIDES WHO ISSUED THE ORDER.  SO, THE QUESTION IS: WHO\nGAVE THE ORDER TO KILL THE JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS.  IN OUR VIEW, COL\nBENAVIDES WAS IMPLICATED SOLELY AS A MEANS OF PROPAGANDA AIMED AT THE U.S.\nCONGRESS.  IT IS CLEAR THAT COL BENAVIDES DID NOT GIVE THE ORDER.  HE\nPROBABLY DID NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE ACTION.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT\nWE KNOW ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND.  FIRST, HE IS NOT KNOWN TO HAVE CARRIED OUT\nACTS OF REPRESSION OR CORRUPTION.  OUR REPORT INDICATES THAT BENAVIDES HAS\n   MAINTAINED A POSITION IN FAVOR OF INSTITUTIONS AND OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS.\nHE WAS DESCRIBED AS AN ACTIVE, STUDIOUS AND NOT REPRESSIVE CADET, ONE OF THE\nFEW EXCEPTIONS IN LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO THE 1977 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE\nCAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY].  IN OTHER WORDS, FOR THE\nLA TANDONA, A GANG OF ASSASSINS, HE IS A PERFECT SCAPEGOAT.\n\n   THE MASSACRE OF THE JESUITS WAS NOT A PERSONAL DECISION.  IT WAS PART OF\nTHE ARMED FORCES' COUNTEROFFENSIVE ACTIONS DURING THE NOVEMBER BATTLES.  IT\nWAS A COLD-BLOODED, PREMEDITATED PLAN EXECUTED TO DECAPITATE THE PEOPLE'S\nMOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION.  LET US REMEMBER THE THREATS AGAINST\nFATHER ELLACURIA OVER THE NATIONAL RADIO NETWORK PRIOR TO THE\nASSASSINATION.  LET US REMEMBER THAT BETWEEN THE NIGHT OF 15 NOVEMBER AND\nEARLY MORNING OF 16 NOVEMBER, SEVERAL OFFICES OF LABOR UNIONS AND HOUSES OF\nOPPOSITION MEMBERS WERE ATTACKED.  LET US REMEMBER THAT AFTER THE MASSSACRE\nOF THE JESUITS, THE OFFICERS SHOUTED OVER LOUDSPEAKERS THAT THEY HAD KILLED\nELLACURIA AND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CONTINUE KILLING COMMUNISTS.  THE\nBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR WAS A WITNESS TO THIS.\n\n   IN OUR VIEW, THE ASSASSINS OF THE JESUITS WERE THOSE WHO APPEARED ON THE\nRADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK MAKING KNOWN THE RESULTS OF THE SO-CALLED HONOR\nCOMMISSION.  COL BENAVIDES WILL PROBABLY BE FREED IN A SHORT TIME AND BE\nAPPOINTED TO SOME POST ABROAD, OR HE MIGHT EXPERIENCE THE SAME FATE AS THAT\nOF CAPTAIN EDUARDO ALFONSO AVILA, WHO WENT IN AND OUT OF JAIL EACH TIME THAT\nMILITARY AID FOR EL SALVADOR WAS DISCUSSED IN THE U.S. CONGRESS.\n\n   HOWEVER, IN ANY CASE AND AS HAS ALWAYS OCCURRED, IT WILL BE THE\nLIEUTENANTS, THE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND THE SOLDIERS WHO CARRIED OUT\nAN ORDER WHO WILL PAY THE CONSEQUENCES.  WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN\nTHE CASES OF THE NUNS WHEN [WORDS INDISTINCT] A FEW SOLDIERS, THE MASSACRE\nOF SAN FRANCISCO, AND THE ASSASSINATION OF THE U.S. ADVISERS AND RODOLFO\nVIERA.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] ONCE AGAIN THE PEOPLE'S HOPES ARE FRUSTRATED, AS\nHAS HAPPENED IN SO MANY OTHER CASES.\n\n   THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS AGAIN CONFIRMS THAT TO, AS CRISTIANI\nSAID, GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS, WE HAVE TO OBTAIN DEMOCRACY, JUSTICE, AND\nSELF-DETERMINATION.",

WE BLAME ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE], THE REGIME OF\n[PRESIDENT ALFREDO] CRISTIANI AND [ARENA LEADER ROBERTO] D'AUBUISSON, AND\nITS ARMED FORCES FOR THIS DETESTABLE ASSASSINATION.  THE LINKS BETWEEN\nD'AUBUISSON'S ARENA PARTY AND THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT OF\nMARIO SANDOVAL ARE WELL KNOWN.  BOTH OPPOSE EVERY EFFORT TO BRING PEACE TO\nTHE REGION.\n\n   2. THIS NEW CRIME AND THE RECENT EVENTS CONCERNING THE CASE OF THE\nJESUITS, WHICH SHOW THAT THE MASTERMINDS WILL NOT BE PUNISHED, FORCES US TO\nREVIEW OUR DIALOGUE OFFER BECAUSE WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HELPING THE\nFASCIST REGIME WASH ITS FACE TO OBTAIN U.S. MILITARY AID AND TO PROCEED WITH\nITS PLAN TO ANNIHILATE EVERY TYPE OF OPPOSITION.\n\n   3. THE ASSASSINATION OF DR OQUELI AND HIS COMPANION, GILDA FLORES, THE\nEXTENSION OF THE STATE OF THE SIEGE, AND THE FACT THAT NOTHING INDICATES\nTHAT THERE WILL BE PUNISHMENT FOR THE MASTERMINDS OF THE MASSACRE OF 16\nNOVEMBER SHOW THAT CRISTIANI'S ANNOUNCEMENT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE\nLATTER CASE IS ONLY A FARCE TO OBTAIN U.S. AID AND TO PROCEED WITH THE\nSLAUGHTER OF OPPOSITION MEMBERS.\n\n   4. AS THOSE EVENTS SHOW, THE POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFICT REQUIRES A\nPURGE OF THE ARMED FORCES, DEMOCRATIZATION, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.  THERE\nCAN BE NO DIALOGUE AMID STATE TERRORISM, A STATE OF SIEGE, AND GENERAL\nTRAMPLING ON HUMAN RIGHTS.  UNDER THE STATE OF SIEGE, THE REGIME GIVES\nITSELF THE RIGHT TO CARRY OUT A GENERAL REPRESSION.  THEREFORE, WE CALL ON\nALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO STRUGGLE FOR ITS ABROGATION.\n\n   5. THE 15 DECEMBER 1989 UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION DEMANDING RESPECT\nFOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS MUST BE UNCONDITIONALLY IMPLEMENTED\nIN OUR COUNTRY TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE AND CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO A\nPOLITICAL SOLUTION.\n\n   [SIGNED] FMLN GENERAL COMMAND\n\n   [DATED] EL SALVADOR, 13 JANUARY 1990",

      "text": "   ROME (ITALY), 11 JAN 90 -- [INTERVIEW WITH DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE\nLEADER RUBEN ZAMORA BY ALESSANDRO OPPES] [EXCERPT] [PASSAGE OMITTED]\n[OPPES] THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS\nDESCRIBED THE ARREST OF FIVE SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING THE\nMASSACRE [OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS] AS \"A MANIPULATED COVER OPERATION.\"\nBASICALLY, CRISTIANI IS ALLEGED TO HAVE DECIDED TO PUNISH A NUMBER OF\nLOW-RANKING OFFICERS TO CLOSE THE CASE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND TO\nEND INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION IN THIS REGARD?\n\n   [ZAMORA] THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MEMBERS OF\nTHE ARMY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MASSACRE IS A FIRST STEP AND DEFINITELY A\nGOOD THING, BUT IT IS ENTIRELY INSUFFICIENT UNLESS THE SUBSEQUENT STEPS ARE\nALSO TAKEN.  FIRST, TO IDENTIFY WHO THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WERE:  THIS IS\nTHE FIRST IMPORTANT POINT, BECAUSE NOBODY CAN FEEL SATISFIED IF ONLY\nLOW-RANKING OFFICERS ARE IDENTIFIED.  SUCH AN ACT CAN ONLY HAVE BEEN ORDERED\nBY HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO,\nFOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SENTENCES AND NO TRIALS.\n\n   [OPPES] HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND IMMEDIATELY DENIED\nINVOLVEMENT IN THE OPERATION, STATING THAT IT WAS AN ISOLATED ACTION\n\"DIVORCED FROM ANY INSTITUTIONAL POLICY.\"\n\n   [ZAMORA] I BELIEVE THIS IS ENTIRELY WRONG: THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT\nFATHERS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AN ISOLATED ACTION.  OVER 7,000 PEOPLE HAVE\nDIED IN EL SALVADOR DURING 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR, AND 90 PERCENT OF THEM WERE\nCIVILIANS.  POLITICAL ASSASSINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT FORCES IS A CONSTANT\nPRACTICE.  FURTHERMORE, TORTURE IS REGULARLY PRACTISED IN EL SALVADOR.  THE\nARMY HIGH COMMAND CANNOT FAIL TO KNOW THIS.  THEY CANNOT CLAIM TO BE\nINNOCENT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITIES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS\nVIOLATIONS.\n\n   [OPPES] YET LAST MONTH THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN HEADS OF STATE IN\nSAN JOSE ENDED WITH A SUCCESS FOR PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, WHO SECURED AN\nEXPLICIT CONDEMNATION OF THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE GUERRILLAS IN\nNOVEMBER, WHEREAS NO SPECIFIC CHARGES WERE LEVELED AT THE GOVERNMENT FOR\nHUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.\n\n   [ZAMORA] THERE IS A POSITIVE FACTOR THAT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND, NAMELY,\nTHE CALL FROM THE FIVE PRESIDENTS FOR A RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE IN EL\nSALVADOR AND THE APPEAL TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO CARRY OUT MEDIATION\nTO THIS END.  BUT IN THE SUMMIT'S FINAL DOCUMENT, IT IS THE FMLN AND THE\nNICARAGUAN CONTRAS WHO PAY THE PRICE FOR THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PRESIDENTS:\nTHESE ARE DIPLOMATIC GAMES THAT DO NOT FACILITATE THE RESTORATION OF PEACE\nIN CENTRAL AMERICA.\n\n   [OPPES] WHAT PATHS CAN BE TAKEN NOW TO ADVANCE THE NEGOTIATIONS?\n\n   [ZAMORA] NEGOTIATIONS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY NECESSARY.  THE GUERRILLA\nOFFENSIVE SHOWS THAT THE FMLN IS A STRONG MILITARY FORCE, BUT ALSO THAT A\nREVOLUTIONARY ATTITUDE DOES NOT EXIST AMONG THE MASSES.  IT ALSO SHOWS THAT\nTHE GOVERNMENT ARMY, AFTER 10 YEARS OF U.S. TRAINING, IS AN ARMY WHOSE\nMILITARY STANCE IS DEFENSIVE, NOT OFFENSIVE (WHICH IS THE KEY TO U.S.\nMILITARY STRATEGY.)  WHILE THIS ALL SHOWS THAT THERE CAN ONLY BE A\nNEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT PRECISELY FOLLOWING\nTHE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE (AND THIS IS THE PARADOX) THE ARMY STIFFENED ITS\nSTANCE AGAINST NEGOTIATIONS.  I BELIEVE THAT SOONER OR LATER COMMON SENSE\nWILL PREVAIL AND IT WILL SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.  AT THE END OF\nNOVEMBER THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE'S ASSISTANT FOR LATIN AMERICA SPOKE\nOFFICIALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THE NEED FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO RESOLVE THE\nCRISIS IN EL SALVADOR: THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SIGN OF A CHANGING SITUATION.",

THE FMLN AND SEVERAL SECTORS, INCLUDING YOUNG ARMED FORCES OFFICERS,\nWERE RIGHT IN POINTING TO THE ARMY AS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS HORRIBLE\nCRIME.  THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ARMED INSTITUTION FOR THIS CASE AND THE\nCASES INVOLVING FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION],\nMONSIGNOR ROMERO, THE NUNS, AND THE U.S. AGRARIAN EXPERTS, AS WELL AS FOR\nTHE BOMBINGS IN THE CITIES AND MASSACRES IN THE RURAL SECTOR, SHOW THAT WE\nWERE RIGHT WHEN WE MENTIONED IN OUR LAST PEACE PROPOSAL THE NEED TO CLEAN UP\nTHE ARMY AND REFORM THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.\n\n   2. TO ADVANCE IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SOLVE\nTHIS CASE.  THE OTHER CASES NEED TO BE SOLVED AND THOSE GUILTY FOR THEM\nSHOULD BE PUNISHED.  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES CANNOT REMAIN AT\nTHE LEVEL OF OFFICERS AND TROOPS WHO ONLY CARRIED OUT ORDERS.  MOST\nIMPORTANT IS TO ESTABLISH RESPONSIBILITY AMONG HIGHER-RANKING OFFICERS\nBECAUSE A DECISION OF THIS SORT COULD NOT BE BEYOND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF\nTHE TOP COMMAND.\n\n   3. IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS\nCONCERNING DEMOCRATIZATION; REFORMING THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM; LIFTING THE STATE\nOF EMERGENCY; REESTABLISHING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, MOBILIZATION, AND\nORGANIZATION; RELEASING THE MORE THAN 3,000 POLITICAL PRISONERS; AND\nSTOPPING THE REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH AND OTHER SECTORS.  \n\n   4. THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY CRISTIANI IS AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE COMPLICATED\nDISCUSSIONS ON U.S. AID FOR EL SALVADOR AND TO CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS\nAID TO MAINTAIN THE WAR.  IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO INCREASE AID TO THE\nSALVADORAN ARMY BECAUSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OR BECAUSE THE CASE MAY BE\nRESOLVED.  SUCH AID WOULD LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEING A CASE LIKE\nTHAT OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS HAPPENING AGAIN.  THE BEST WAY TO CONTRIBUTE TO A\nNEGOTIATED SOLUTION IS TO CEASE AID.  WE APPEAL TO THE U.S. CONGRESS TO MAKE\nTHIS DECISION.  IF THIS IS DONE, THE FMLN WOULD COMMIT ITSELF TO MAKING\nEFFORTS TO REACH AN IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.\n\n   5. FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR NEGOTIATIONS DEPEND ON JUSTICE-MAKING\nPROGRESS.  IF THE ARMY IS THOROUGHLY PURGED BECAUSE OF THIS CASE, PEACE\nCOULD BE REACHED EARLIER.\n\n   6. TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A PROMPT PEACE, WE WILL ASK THE OFFICE OF THE UN\nSECRETARY GENERAL TO MEDIATE.  WE URGE THE GOVERNMENT TO JOINTLY MEET WITH\nUS AND WITH MR JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR WITHIN THE NEXT 30 DAYS TO RENEW THE\nDIALOGUE-NEGOTIATION PROCESS.\n\n   7. THE FMLN WILL BE WATCHING HOW THE SITUATION DEVELOPS.  IT URGES\nNATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL FORCES TO EXERT PRESSURE SO THAT THE\nINVESTIGATION PROCESS DOES NOT END WITH A DECLARATION OF INTENTION OR WITH\nSTATEMENTS BLAMING LOW-RANKING SOLDIERS TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE MOST\nRESPONSIBLE.  THIS WOULD PUSH AWAY THE POSSIBILTIY OF A POLITICAL SOLUTION\nTO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT.\n\n   [SIGNED] FMLN GENERAL COMMAND: COMMANDERS SALVADOR SANCHEZ, SHAFICK JORGE\nHANDAL, EDUARDO SANCHO, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, AND FRANCISCO JOVEL.",

HE LEFT THE EMBASSY OF HIS OWN WILL.\n\n   THERE ARE OTHER PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES OFFICERS AT THE EMBASSY,\nINCLUDING MR NORIEGA'S SECRETARY, BUT THEIR STATUS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED BY\nPERU.\n\n   AN INCIDENT WAS REPORTED YESTERDAY, AS THE U.S. TROOPS SURROUNDED THE\nEMBASSY, DEPLOYING BARRIERS AND BARBED WIRE.\n\n   THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO DEPICT A DRAMATIC AND SPECTACULAR PICTURE OF A\nSIEGE OR PERHAPS OF AN INVASION OF THE EMBASSY. \n\n   FORTUNATELY, THE FOREIGN MINISTRY RESORTED TO DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS AND THE\nTROOPS WERE SOON WITHDRAWN.

      "text": "   SANTIAGO, 9 JAN 90 -- [COMMENTARY] [OLGA KLIVADENKO] [TEXT] THE\nDEPLOYMENT OF U.S.  SHIPS, INCLUDING THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER \"JOHN F.\nKENNEDY\" AND THE CORVETTE \"VIRGINIA\" ALONG THE COLOMBIAN COAST YESTERDAY,\nSEEKING TO INTERCEPT DRUG TRAFFICKING ROUTES, COULD BE THE RESULT OF THREE\nPOLICIES:\n\n   FIRST, THAT THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO JUSTIFY THE INVASION OF PANAMA\nUNDER THE EXCUSE OF ITS FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.\n\n   SECOND, THAT BOTH THE DEPLOYMENT OF SHIPS AND THE INVASION OF PANAMA ARE\nPART OF A SERIOUS MILITARY PLAN TO END THE DRUG PLAGUE.\n\n   THIRD, THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST SOMEHOW JUSTIFY THE INVASION OF PANAMA\nAND THE NEED TO RECOVER ITS INTERNATIONAL IMAGE HAS PROVIDED A REAL\nOPPORTUNITY TO PUT AN END TO DRUG TRAFFICKING.\n\n   IF THE OBJECTIVE REALLY IS TO ELIMINATE DRUGS, THEN THE BATTLE IS\nPRAISEWORTHY, BUT--LIKE IN PANAMA--THE PROCEDURE IS PAINFUL, OVERBEARING,\nIMPERIALISTIC, AND HUMILIATING.  INSTEAD OF WINNING THE LATIN AMERICAN\nCOUNTRIES' APPRECIATION AND SOLIDARITY WITH THIS LAUDABLE CAUSE, THE UNITED\nSTATES IS AGAIN PROVOKING ANGRY REACTIONS AND DEEP DISTRUST.  THE SIDE\nEFFECTS OF THIS ACTION COULD BE VERY NEGATIVE FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKING, IN WHICH ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THIS CONTINENT SHOULD BE\nCOOPERATING.  ALTERNATIVELY, WOULD IT BE BETTER IF THEY DID NOT COOPERATE IN\nTHIS PHASE?\n\n   COULD IT BE THAT WHAT WE HAVE CALLED IMPERIALISTIC CLUMSINESS,\nINSENSIBILITY, AND ABUSE, IS SIMPLY A DELIBERATE STRATEGY WITH WHICH,\nPERHAPS FOR WELL FOUNDED REASONS AND EVEN AT THE RISK OF DIPLOMATIC\nCONFLICTS, THE UNITED STATES SEEKS TO ISOLATE LATIN AMERICA ON PURPOSE AND\nTHUS ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF ITS OPERATION?  IF THIS WERE THE CASE THEN WE\nMUST ASK, WHY?\n\n   FROM ITS OPERATIONS IN PANAMA AND COLOMBIA, THE UNITED STATES IS TELLING\nUS THAT IT IS NOT CONCERNED WITH THE DIPLOMATIC ASPECT FOR THE TIME BEING.\nTHE UNITED STATES WANTS ACTION AND EFFICIENCY.  THE UNITED STATES IS LOSING\nITS PATIENCE, AND PERHAPS ITS CONFIDENCE IN THE SERIOUSNESS AND CAPABILITY OF\nLATIN AMERICA TO FACE THIS WAR.\n\n   IF THE ACTION IN COLOMBIA GOES FURTHER THAN A MERE SURVEILLANCE, THE\nUNITED STATES WILL BE ESTABLISHING A PRECEDENT IN THIS BATTLE AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKING.  THIS MEANS THAT DURING A FIRST PHASE THE UNITED STATES WILL\nCARRY OUT A MILITARY OPERATION BY ITSELF.  DURING A SECOND PHASE IT WILL\nDISCUSS SECONDARY SUBJECTS BUT WITH LESS URGENCY IN THE WAR AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKING.\n\n   NEXT 15 FEBRUARY, BUSH WILL MEET IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS, COLOMBIA, WITH\nHIS COLOMBIAN, PERUVIAN, AND BOLIVIAN COUNTERPARTS.  PERHAPS ON THAT OCCASION\nTHEY WILL TALK ABOUT THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS WAR: THE REORGANIZATION OF\nTHE LOCAL ECONOMIES TO END THE DEPENDENCY ON COCA PLANTATIONS, THE RECOVERY\nOF DRUG ADDICTS, AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF GOVERNMENTS, ETC.\n\n   DURING THIS CURRENT PHASE, HOWEVER, THE UNITED STATES WISHES TO ACT ALONE.\nWHO KNOWS IF IT IS BECAUSE OF LATIN AMERICA'S LACK OF UNDERSTANDING?  AS WE\nSAID A FEW DAYS AGO, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM IS CREATING NEW SITUATIONS\nIN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.  THE U.S. PROPOSAL IS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE:\nCOULD A WORLD POWER LIKE THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO IGNORE A SERIOUS\nPROBLEM LIKE THE PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS, MERELY\nTO AVOID HARMING LATIN AMERICAN SENSIBILITIES, SENSIBILITIES OF COUNTRIES\nWHOSE GOVERNMENTS ARE ALWAYS MUDDLED UP IN USELESS DIPLOMATIC AND\nBUREAUCRATIC PROCEDURES AND FRUITLESS NEGOTIATIONS?  AND ALL THIS WHILE A\nLARGE PART OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD'S POPULATION IS BECOMING ADDICTED TO A\nDEADLY PRODUCT?\n\n   THE UNITED STATES COULD ALSO BE ASKING ITSELF: HAVE THE LATIN AMERICAN\nGOVERNMENTS BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM BY THEMSELVES?  CAN\nTHOSE GOVERNMENTS STOP DRUG TRAFFICKING WHEN IT IS KNOWN THAT DRUGS AND\nCORRUPTION GO HAND IN HAND; WHEN IN THE PAST AND PERHAPS IN THE PRESENT,\nHIGH RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN LINKED WITH THIS ILLEGAL TRADE\nAND PROTECTING THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CHIEFS?  WHY, FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER ALL THIS\nHASN'T THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT MANAGED TO EXTRADITE THE MAIN CHIEFS OF THAT\nCARTEL TO THE UNITED STATES?\n\n   LET US RECALL THE HORRIBLE EXPLOSION OF THE COLOMBIAN AIRLINER, IN WHICH\nMORE THAN 100 PEOPLE DIED; THE BOMB EXPLOSION IN THE SECRET POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS IN BOGOTA; THE MURDER OF MANY JOURNALISTS WHO WERE ENGAGED IN\nAN HEROIC WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING; AND MAINLY, LET US RECALL THE\nEVER-PRESENT DIFFICULTIES THAT MUST BE FACED WHEN THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CHIEFS\nMUST BE PUNISHED AND EXTRADITED.",

THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION FURTHER\nISOLATES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE\nBECAUSE OF CALLS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARY\nAID.  THIS SUSPENSION REPRESENTS A HALT IN THE DELIVERY OF MILLIONS OF\nDOLLARS FROM THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.\n\n   THIS REPRESENTS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.

THE PLANE DEPARTED\nBOGOTA TOWARD CALI, AT 1213 GMT, BUT TWO POWERFUL EXPLOSION BROUGHT IT\nDOWN AFTER ONLY 5 MINUTES IN THE AIR.  BOMB-SQUAD EXPERTS, IN\nCOORDINATION WITH THREE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS, HAVE STARTED TO\nEXAMINE THE SITE TO INVESTIGATE THE ACCIDENT AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE\nTRAGEDY WAS CAUSED BY A MECHANICAL FAILURE, OR IF IT WAS A TERRORIST\nACTION.  THE BOGOTA CARACOL NETWORK RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS CALL FROM\nTHE EXTRADITABLES -- COLOMBIAN DRUG KINGPINS WANTED BY SEVERAL U.S.\nFEDERAL COURTS -- WHO SAID THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTION.\nANOTHER NETWORK REPORTS THAT THE MAN WHO CALLED THE CARACOL NETWORK\nNEWS OFFICE SAID HE BELONGED TO THE EXTRADITABLES AND THAT THE ACTION\nWAS CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THERE WERE FIVE INFORMERS ON THE PLANE.  THE\nPOLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THE EXPLOSIONS THAT\nCAUSED THE PLANE TO CRASH SHORTLY AFTER IT LEFT THE BOGOTA EL DORADO\nAIRPORT TO GO TO CALI.",

      "text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 26 JUN 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [INTERVIEW WITH\nSALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BY MILTON GRIMALDI] [TEXT]\nPRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID TODAY THAT DESPITE THE FARABUNDO\nMARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S [FMLN] TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST\nSALVADORANS, HIS GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE REBELS.\nHE SAID THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING ITS EFFORTS TO FORM A\nCOMMISSION FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS AND THAT HE IS NOW AWAITING\nWORD FROM TWO PEOPLE WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN TO SERVE ON THE COMMISSION.\nTHE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED ON THE COMMISSION BECAUSE\nTHE COMMISSION IS COMPLETELY POLITICAL IN NATURE.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI\nCONDEMNED THE MURDER OF NATIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR COLONEL\nROBERTO ARMANDO RIVERA ESCOBAR, WHO WAS KILLED IN A MACHINEGUN ATTACK\nTHIS MORNING.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ATTRIBUTED RIVERA'S MURDER TO THE\nFMLN:\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT\nWANT PEACE BUT INSTEAD WANTS TO CONTINUE THE VIOLENCE.  THE FMLN\nCOMMITTED THIS CRIME.  I BELIEVE THAT A TREACHEROUS CRIME SUCH AS THIS\nONE CANNOT BE CALLED ANYTHING BUT A COWARDLY ACT.  WE WILL, OF COURSE,\nINVESTIGATE THE CRIME.  I REPEAT, HOWEVER, THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE WE\nHAVE GATHERED ON THE FMLN'S PLANS INDICATE THAT IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR\nTHIS ACTION.\n\n   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PREPARE THE\nCOMMISSION THAT IS TO HOLD TALKS [WORDS INDISTINCT]?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] THE TERRORISTS WILL NOT OF COURSE BE SUCCESSFUL WITH\nACTIONS OF THIS KIND AND WILL NOT PROVOKE US INTO VIOLENT ACTION.\nTHEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND BY NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SEARCHING FOR\nPEACE AND WANTS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN EL SALVADOR'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK\nAND BY APPLYING THE LAW.  THE FMLN REBELS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR\nTERRORIST ACTIONS WILL NOT LEAD US TO TAKE RASH ACTIONS; IT IS USELESS\nFOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO ACT IN THIS WAY.\n\n   WE ARE CONTINUING OUR WORK ON SETTING UP THE COMMISSION.  TODAY WE\nWILL SPEAK WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE STILL NOT TOLD US IF THEY WILL\nACCEPT MY INVITATION TO BE COMMISSION MEMBERS.  THE NAMES OF THE\nCOMMISSION MEMBERS WILL BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC ONCE THE COMMISSION\nIS FULLY FORMED.\n\n   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S ROLE IN THIS\nCOMMISSION?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE\nREPRESENTED IN THIS COMMISSION BECAUSE IT IS A POLITICAL COMMISSION\nAND NOT ONE IN WHICH THE CHURCH CAN EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE.  THE\nCHURCH HAS ALWAYS WORKED FOR PEACE AND HAS MADE ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS\nTO FIND PEACE FOR THE COUNTRY THE CHURCH WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD\nTHIS GOAL.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THE CHURCH HAS A DIFFERENT ROLE TO\nPLAY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, AND THAT ROLE IS NOT SERVING ON THE\nPOLITICAL COMMISSION.\n\n   [REPORTER] WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE YOU HAVE\nENCOUNTERED IN THE MONTH THAT YOU HAVE SERVED AS PRESIDENT?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE HAS BEEN OUR\nINABILITY TO LAUNCH OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, WHICH IS DUE TO THE STATE\nOF AFFAIRS EXISTING IN THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE TOOK OVER. WE\nHAVE REPEATEDLY OBSERVED THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE MAJORITY OF\nGOVERNMENT [WORD INDISTINCT].  THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT OFFICES, DISORDER\nWAS RAMPANT, AND, IN MANY CASES, WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT GOVERNMENT\nOFFICES WERE MANAGED IRRESPONSIBLY.  MOREOVER, THE NATION'S PUBLIC\nFINANCES HAVE GREATLY DETERIORATED.  WE HAVE INHERITED A COUNTRY IN\nVERY BAD FINANCIAL SHAPE, AND, I BELIEVE, THIS HAS DELAYED THE\nLAUNCHING OF OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. [END RECORDING]\n\n   CRISTIANI, REFERRING TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS' OFFER TO\nHOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS IN COSTA RICAN TERRITORY, SAID THAT\nTHE OFFER WAS A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TOWARD CONVINCING THE FMLN TO STOP\nMURDERING DEFENSELESS CITIZENS.",

      "text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 90 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT] [ALFREDO\nVILLAREAL] [TEXT] THE CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF\n[COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE] HAS CATEGORICALLY DENIED THAT THERE ARE\nANY RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN ARMY OFFICERS AND U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS,\nAS ASSERTED BY THE WASHINGTON POST.  THE NEWSPAPER STATED THAT THE\nALLEGED RIFT BETWEEN THE MILITARY OFFICERS BEGAN ONCE IT WAS\nDISCOVERED WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, IN\nWHICH ONE COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, AND SIX SOLDIERS ARE BEING\nCHARGED.\n\n   COLONEL PONCE SAID THAT THE RELATIONS WITH U.S. ADVISERS -- ABOUT\n52 IN THE COUNTRY -- ARE VERY CORDIAL.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NORTH AMERICANS\nARE NORMAL AS USUAL.  THE U.S. ADVISERS HAVE HELPED US VERY MUCH IN\nTHE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THEY CONTINUE WORKING\nWITH US.\n\n   [REPORTER] WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE WIRE REPORTS STATING THERE ARE\nRIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN MILITARY OFFICERS AND U.S.  ADVISERS HAVE\nORGINIATED?\n\n   [PONCE] I DO NOT KNOW; I CANNOT UNDERSTAND.  THERE ARE ALWAYS\nTHOSE WHO TRY TO BREAK THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN\nGOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES.  THIS IS A POOR\nCOUNTRY THAT DEPENDS A GREAT DEAL ON U.S. ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID.\n\n   [REPORTER] FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS, WHAT ARE RELATIONS\nLIKE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND THE GRINGO ADVISERS?\n\n   [PONCE] AS USUAL, THESE RELATIONS ARE VERY CORDIAL, AND THEY\nCONTINUE TO WORK WITH US.  AS YOU CAN SEE, TWO ADVISERS ARE HERE WITH\nME NOW AT THE TABLE PRESIDING OVER THE EVENT.  THE SAME HAS BEEN THE\nCASE WITH ALL THE UNITS IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR.  I FAIL TO SEE ANY\nDIFFERENCE IN RELATIONS BEFORE AND AFTERWARD. [END RECORDING]\n\n   THE MILITARY CHIEF REPEATED THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE STATE OF\nEMERGENCY, NOT ONLY DUE TO THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS, BUT ALSO TO KEEP\nCONTROL OVER THE ORGANIZATION FRONTS JUST PRIOR TO AN EXPECTED WAVE OF\nPROTESTS ON THE LATEST GOVERNMENT ECONOMY MEASURES.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] WE MUST START THINKING WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO\nDOMESTIC ORDER IN THE FACE OF THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN\nISSUED OR ARE PLANNED.  WE MUST THINK WHAT THE REACTION OF THE PEOPLE\nOR THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] ORGANIZATION\nFRONTS WILL BE, AS THEY ALWAYS USE ANY EXCUSE TO DISRUPT DOMESTIC\nORDER.  IT WOULD BE GOOD TO LOOK INTO WHAT IS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN\nDOMESTIC ORDER IN THE COUNTRY. [END RECORDING]\n\n   THE HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICER GAVE THESE STATEMENTS AT THE\nCEREMONY TO TURN OVER COMMAND OF THE CAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS\nMILITARY ACADEMY.  THE NEW COMMANDER IS COLONEL RICARDO ALFONSO\nCASANOVA SANDOVAL, WHO REPLACES COLONEL GUILLERMO ALFREDO BENAVIDES\nMORENO, REMOVED FROM HIS POST AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF ORDERING THE\nMURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.\n\n   MEANWHILE, COLONEL HECTOR HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ HAS BEEN APPOINTED\nCOMMANDER OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE BASED IN USULUTAN, AND IN LA\nUNION DEPARTMENT THE CHANGE OF COMMAND CEREMONIES OF THE ARMED FORCES\nMILITARY TRAINING CENTER HAVE TAKEN PLACE, WHERE COLONEL FRANCISCO\nARTURO LOPEZ WILL BE IN COMMAND REPLACING COLONEL CARLOS ALFREDO\nRIVAS, WHO HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.",

      "text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 22 APR 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT\nALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] DEAR RADIO AUDIENCE: FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO\nTHANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TALK TO YOU TONIGHT ABOUT A VERY\nIMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY.  MANY TIMES YOU HAVE\nHEARD US MENTION THE WORD SOLIDARITY.  WE HAVE ALWAYS USED IT AS A\nWORD THAT MEANS TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO SUFFER THE MOST, THOSE WHO\nHAVE LESS.  INDEED, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE MUST HELP, EVEN WITH OUR\nOWN SACRIFICE, AND MANY TIMES WITH A HUGE SACRIFICE BY ALL OF US.  IF\nLOVE IS THE BOND THAT UNITES FAMILY MEMBERS, SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE\nGREAT PILLAR, THE CEMENT THAT UNITES SALVADORAN SOCIETY, SO THAT,\nUNITED, WE MAY FULFILL OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE, TRANQUILITY, HAPPINESS,\nAND WELL-BEING.\n\n   HOWEVER, TONIGHT ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE\nCONSIDER SHOULD BE THE USE OF THE WORD SOLIDARITY AND WHAT THIS WORD\nMEANS IN MATTERS THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER.  A\nFEW WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OIL\nPRICES, TO RAISE THE PRICE OF OIL BYPRODUCTS SUCH AS GASOLINE, DIESEL,\nAND ALL FUELS.  IN THE PAST, THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE.\nPERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT DID THIS TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAVE\nNOTHING BUT POSITIVE EFFECTS.  HOWEVER, LET US ANALYZE FOR A WHILE THE\nISSUE OF INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF FUEL.  WHEN A GOVERNMENT HAS NO\nMONEY FOR SUBSIDIZING, THAT MEANS THE COST OF LIVING WILL GO UP.\nTHERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PRICES WILL RISE WHEN A GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE\nTHAN WHAT IT HAS.  HOWEVER, LET US SEE HOW THIS ASPECT, OR RATHER THE\nPRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY, APPLIES TO THE INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES,\nESPECIALLY THE PRICE OF GASOLINE.\n\n   TEN PERCENT OF ALL FAMILIES IN OUR COUNTRY OWN A VEHICLE.  IN\nGENERAL, THAT 10 PERCENT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST; IN OTHER WORDS,\nTHOSE WHO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A CAR, A VEHICLE.  IF WE\nSUBSIDIZED GASOLINE, WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF A\nGOVERNMENT THAT, FOR THE TIME BEING, DOES NOT HAVE SUCH FUNDS\nAVAILABLE.  IN ORDER TO GET SUCH FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO\nIMPOSE NEW TAXES WHICH WOULD AFFECT ALL SALVADORANS.  THEREFORE, LET\nUS THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FAIR THAT 90 PERCENT OF ALL SALVADORAN\nFAMILIES, WHO OWN NO VEHICLES, MUST PAY SOME KIND OF TAX IN ORDER TO\nBENEFIT THE OTHER 10 PERCENT WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ALLOW THEM TO\nBUY A VEHICLE.\n\n   WE DO NOT WANT TO APPEAR AS DEMAGOGIC OR POPULIST WITH THIS\nEXAMPLE.  WHAT WE WANT TO SAY IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO OWN A VEHICLE,\nWHO ARE PART OF THE 10 PERCENT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING AND THUS\nCAN BUY A VEHICLE, MUST BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THAT 90 PERCENT WHO HAVE\nLITTLE AND MANY TIMES NOTHING.  THEY HAVE NO VEHICLES, AND THEREFORE\nHAVE NO REASON TO SUFFER SO THE GASOLINE WE BUY BECOMES CHEAPER.\nMOREOVER, TO SOME EXTENT THE CURRENT PRICE OF GASOLINE MAKES IT\nPOSSIBLE FOR THE DIESEL SUPPLIED TO URBAN AND INTERURBAN BUS COMPANIES\nTO BE BOUGHT AT A PRICE THAT WILL ALLOW BUS OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THE\nCURRENT BUS FARES.  THIS IS SOLIDARITY, AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT.\nTHOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING, WHO OWN A VEHICLE, PAY SOMETHING --\nTHROUGH THE PRICE OF THE GASOLINE WE CONSUME -- SO THAT THOSE WHO OWN\nNOTHING AND MUST USE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BUSES CAN DO SO WITH NO\nPRICE INCREASE.\n\n   THE SAME SHOULD BE THE CASE FOR THE COST OF LIQUID GAS AND PROPANE\nGAS, SO THAT THE PRICES OF FOOD COOKED WITH GAS IN THE MARKETPLACES\nARE NOT INCREASED.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THOSE OF US WHO HAVE\nSOMETHING CAN SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LITTLE OR\nNOTHING AT ALL.\n\n   I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AN EXAMPLE OF AN EVEN DEEPER KIND OF\nSOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PEACE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, THIS IS\nTHE TIME WHEN WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE MOTHERS WHO HAVE\nLOST THEIR SONS.  WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THE INNOCENT\nCHILDREN WHO COULD KICK A MINE AND END UP WITHOUT AN ARM OR A LEG.  WE\nMUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO, BECAUSE OF VIOLENCE, CANNOT\nFIND A JOB.  THAT IS WHY THIS IS THE TIME FOR ALL OF US TO MAKE AN\nEFFORT TO ACHIEVE PEACE.\n\n   LAST THURSDAY I TOLD YOU I FELT MORE OPTIMISTIC AFTER MEETING WITH\nTHE POLITICAL PARTIES AND LISTENING TO THEIR DECISION TO ACCEPT THE\nCHALLENGE TO WORK FOR PEACE.  THEY ARE DETERMINED TO REACH A CONSENSUS\nTO FULFILL THE ASPIRATIONS OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE ARE BEGINNING TO\nSENSE WHAT THE NEAR FUTURE OF EL SALVADOR COULD BE.  WE ARE FEELING\nHAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE\nSHOULD ALL CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE.\n\n   ANYTHING THAT MAY LEAD TO VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT IS STREET\nDISTURBANCES OR BOMBS, SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED, BECAUSE IT IS NO\nLONGER CONCEIVABLE FOR MOTHERS, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO\nSUFFER IN OUR COUNTRY.  THE TIME HAS COME TO SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY, TO\nSEARCH, NOT ONLY THROUGH WORDS BUT ALSO THROUGH OUR EXAMPLES AND\nACTIONS, FOR THE PEACE THAT OUR COUNTRY AND SALVADORANS DESERVE.\n\n   THEREFORE, OUR SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR OUR\nCOUNTRY'S RECONSTRUCTION.  IT SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR THE\nPHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL RECONSTRUCTION OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE WANT ALL\nSALVADORANS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, TO SUPPORT THE PEACE EFFORTS, SO THAT\nTHOSE WHO SUFFER SO VERY MUCH FROM VIOLENCE WILL NO LONGER SUFFER.\n\n   THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL STEP FORWARD FOR THE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY OF\nTHE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US SHOW OUR\nSOLIDARITY IN THIS CRUCIAL TIME IN OUR HISTORY, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALWAYS\nKNOWN THAT WHEN ALL SALVADORANS ACT POSITIVELY LIKE BROTHERS, WE CAN\nCOME OUT AHEAD.  THIS IS ALL FOR TONIGHT.  THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND\nMAY GOD BLESS YOU.  ",

I THEREFORE WANTED TO\nCONVEY A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO EVERY CHILEAN, TO SHOW\nTHEM MY FEELINGS AT THIS TIME OF DEEP REFLECTION.\n\n   FROM THE VERY MOMENT I LEARNED ABOUT THIS TERRORIST ECONOMIC\nAGGRESSION, I ORDERED THE CREATION OF FOUR MINISTERIAL COMMISSIONS TO\nTACKLE THE PROBLEM. I ALSO SENT TWO MINISTERS TO THE UNITED STATES TO\nMEET WITH U.S.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. AFTER TIRING SESSIONS OF TALKS,\nTHESE MINISTERS MANAGED TO OVERCOME A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE GRAPE\nPROBLEM. THE PROBLEM AFFECTING OTHER FRUITS REMAINS TO BE SOLVED.\n\n   THIS NEW ATTACK AGAINST THE CHILEAN NATION, AN ATTACK THAT DESTINY\nHAS PLACED IN THE NATION'S PATH OF FREEDOM, PROGRESS, AND WELL-BEING,\nCOMPELS US TO CLOSE RANKS BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT, UNIFIED AND READY TO\nFIGHT -- WITH COURAGE AND HIGH SPIRIT -- THE PROBLEM THAT FACES US.\n\n   ON THIS OCCASION THE COUNTRY HAS SEEN HOW THE COUNTLESS THREATS TO\nBOYCOTT THE NATIONAL ECONOMY HAVE WORKED. MOST OF THE TIME SUCH\nTHREATS HAVE BEEN PROMOTED BY CERTAIN POLITICIANS, LABOR LEADERS, OR\nCOMMUNIST LABOR UNIONS, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO\n-- DRIVEN BY PERSONAL OR IDEOLOGICAL INTEREST -- HAVE CONTINUALLY\nJEOPARDIZED THE STABILITY OF WORKERS, OF FAMILIES, AND OF THOSE WHOM\nTHEY DEMAGOGICALLY CALL THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN. THEY DO NOT CARE IF\nTHEY CAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, AND HUNGER TO 500,000 FELLOW\nCITIZENS WHO WORK IN THIS AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY.\n\n   HOW SHAMELESSLY THEY MAKE CLAIMS AND DEMANDS, OFFERING THEIR\nSUPPORT AND THEIR SOLIDARITY WHEN CHILE IS SERIOUSLY THREATENED! YET\nWHEN THE DANGER IS OVER, THEY CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE AND AGAIN LEVEL\nCHARGES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND CRITICIZE ITS ACTIONS. IN DOING\nTHAT THEY FAIL TO RECALL THAT FROM ITS VERY BEGINNING THE CHILEAN\nNATION HAS BEEN BUILT UPON NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THEY ARE\nTHE ESSENCE OF THE NATIONAL SOUL.\n\n   GENTLEMEN: OUR WILL IS BASED ON OUR FEELING OF UNITY IN THE FACE OF\nADVERSITY, WHETHER FROM THE ACTION OF NATURE OR FROM THE ACTION OF\nTREACHEROUS, DISTURBED MINDS THAT RECOGNIZE NO MORAL VALUES,\nFATHERLAND, OR LAW.\n\n   CHILEANS: A FEW DAYS AGO I REPORTED ON THE STEPS FORWARD IN THE\nINSTITUTIONALIZATION PROCESS AND ON THE PROGRESS THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS\nMADE IN ALL FIELDS.\n\n   THE FACT THAT CYANIDE HAS BEEN INJECTED INTO TWO EXPORTED GRAPES\nHAS CAUSED INCALCULABLE DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY; IT HAS ALSO BROUGHT THE\nSHADOW OF ANGUISH AND UNCERTAINTY TO THOUSANDS OF HOMES OF FELLOW\nCOUNTRYMEN WHOSE JOBS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO A\nLIVELIHOOD HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY JEOPARDIZED. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT\nSOME OFFICIALS OF IMPORTING COUNTRIES, WITHOUT WEIGHING THE TRUE\nEFFECTS OF THIS TYPE OF MEASURE, HAVE RESTRICTED THE IMPORT OF CHILEAN\nFRUITS, THUS PROVOKING FEAR AND DISTRUST ON THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER\nMARKET. GENTLEMEN, WE MUST REVERSE THIS SITUATION.\n\n   WE SHOULD ONCE AGAIN ACT IN A UNITED MANNER TO RECOVER\nINTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE AND OUR UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP AS EXPORTERS.\nI AM SURE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED WITH A NEW JOINT EFFORT.

WE HAVE NOT RETREATED A\nSINGLE STEP. IF WE MAKE ANY MOVE, IT WILL BE TO ADVANCE TOWARD THE\nENEMY BARRACKS, BECAUSE WE WILL SEIZE POWER AND EXPEL THE MILITARY\nDICTATORSHIP THAT HAS INSTALLED ITSELF IN OUR HOMELAND.  THE FMLN\nMAINTAINS FOR THE 7TH DAY ITS POSITIONS IN THE DEPARTMENTAL CAPITALS.\nWE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE IN SAN MIGUEL; WE HAVE MADE AN IMPORTANT\nSEIZURE OF WEAPONS IN SAN MIGUEL.\n\n   THE SITUATION COULD NOT BE BETTER IN SAN SALVADOR.  LAST NIGHT WE\nREPORTED THAT THE ARCH OF LIBERTY EXISTS IN THE CAPITAL; IT IS\nCOMPRISED OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND HOUSING PROJECTS -- WHERE THE\nPROTAGONISTS OF THIS HISTORY ARE THE MASSES, WHICH ARE ORGANIZED FOR\nTHE CONSTRUCTION OF TRENCHES AND BARRICADES.  THE PEOPLE ARE THE MOST\nIMPORTANT PROTAGONISTS IN THIS HISTORIC ACTION.\n\n   RADIO VENCEREMOS URGES THE PEOPLE TO MULTIPLY THEIR ORGANIZATION IN\nEACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN.  POPULAR COMMITTEES\nMUST BE ORGANIZED; THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVES; BUT IF THE\nENEMY IS NEAR, THIS MUST BE DONE CLANDESTINELY.  ALL THE GROUPS IN\nEACH TOWN, MEANING THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS, STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS,\nTEACHERS ORGANIZATIONS, AND COOPERATIVES, MUST ALL ORGANIZE,\nREGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICAL BELIEFS.  OUR UNITY MUST BECOME THE BEST\nTOOL TO EVICT, ONCE AND FOR ALL, THE MURDEROUS MILITARY DICTATORSHIP\nWHICH ASSASSINATES PRIESTS AND WHICH BOMBED THE CAPITAL AGAIN EARLY\nTHIS MORNING.  IT HAS AGAIN CAUSED MORE DEATHS AND WOUNDED IN SAN\nSALVADOR.\n\n   IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE COMMITTEES IN EACH\nNEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN, AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY MUST\nPARTICIPATE. IF THE ARMED FORCES ARE NEAR, THEN CLANDESTINE\nORGANIZATION MUST BE CONDUCTED IN SMALL TOWNS, VILLAGES, AND\nNEIGHBORHOODS.  THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVE TO CONSPIRE AGAINST\nDEATH, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE ASSASSINS, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST POVERTY,\nTO CONSPIRE AGAINST HUNGER, AND TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE BOMBINGS.  IT\nIS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE; IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE\nENTIRE COUNTRY.  EL SALVADOR MUST BECOME A BODY COMPRISED OF ORGANIZED\nCELLS -- EVERYWHERE AND IN EVERY POSSIBLE FORM -- REGARDLESS OF THE\nPEOPLE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR POLITICAL PARTY.\n\n   WE ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE DECEIVED ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN\nALLIANCE] RANK AND FILE, WHO VOTED BELIEVING THAT THIS GOVERNMENT\nWOULD REPRESENT A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.  WE ALSO ISSUE AN APPEAL TO\nALL THE PATRIOTIC CITIZENS OF THE HOMELAND, URGING THEM TO STOP THE\nDESTRUCTION OF THE CAPITAL, TO STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY.\nWE URGE THEM TO UNITE AND STOP THE WAR; AND THE END OF THE WAR IS NEAR\n-- WITH THE PEOPLE'S VICTORY.

      "text": "   RIO DE JANEIRO (BRAZIL), NO DATE (O GLOBO) -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED]\nLAWYER CARLOS OLDINEY REPORTED THE GANG AND FEDERAL AGENTS VALDEMIR\nLOPEZ PRAZERES AND LUIS JOSE DA CONCEICAO AND DETECTIVES PAULO\nMASSANHYO AND CARLOS ANGEL SERRANO CASTILESSO WERE ARRESTED.\n\n   CAMBARALAMAIA'S ORGANIZATION IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY GANGS IN THE\nREGION THAT DEALS WITH BOLIVIAN COCAINE.  ANOTHER GANG IS LED BY\nGERSON PALERMO, OF UMUARAMA, PARANA STATE, WHO CONTROLS THE EXCHANGE\nOF COCAINE TO PARAGUAY FOR STOLEN BRAZILIAN CARS.  PALERMO OWNS FOUR\nTWIN-ENGINED CESSNA PLANES AND EMPLOYS MORE THAN 200 MEN.  HE ALSO\nEXCHANGE CARS FOR COCAINE IN BOLIVIA.  ALTHOUGH SENTENCED BY THE\nBRAZILIAN COURTS, PALERMO LIVES IN PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO, PARAGUAY,\nWHERE HE MAINTAINS BUSINESS CONTACTS WITH THE BOLIVIAN COCA PRODUCERS.\nPALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR REFINING\nTHE DRUG, FROM ARGENTINA.\n\n   THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVES THAT THE DRUG MIGHT BE REFINED IN MATO\nGROSSO DO SUL, NEAR SOME RESIDENCES IN THE DOURADOS AND CAMPO GRANDE\nSECTORS.  PALERMO EXCHANGES THE CHEMICALS FOR TONS OF COCAINE PASTE\nWHICH, IN THE OPINION OF REGIONAL FEDERAL POLICE DELEGATE FRANCISCO\nVIANA QUEIROZ, IS ALSO PROCESSED IN PARAGUAY.  VIANA QUEIROZ MAINTAINS\nTHAT THE DRUG IS REFINED BY A GROUP OF TRAFFICKERS LED BY ARSENIO\nBENITEZ GONZALEZ, WHO IS KNOWN AS VILHAR AND WHO LIVES IN ASUNCION.\nTHE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVE THAT VILHAR -- WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE\nPALERMO'S PARTNER -- IS THE BRAZILIAN TRAFFICKERS' MAIN COCAINE\nSUPPLIER.\n\n   ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, TWO DRUG ROUTES PASS THROUGH MATO GROSSO\nDO SUL: THE PONTA PORA ROUTE (WHICH IS USED BY PALERMO), AND THE\nCORUMBA ROUTE, WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE BOLIVIAN TOWN OF PUERTO\nSUAREZ.  MANY TRAFFICKERS COME TO THIS BOLIVIAN TOWN, MOST OF THEM\nSMALL SUPPLIERS WHO ONLY WANT TO EXCHANGE COCAINE FOR CARS THAT WERE\nSTOLEN IN BRAZIL.  ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THE CORUMBA ROUTE IS\nMORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CHANNELS THE SO-CALLED \"MINI-TRAFFIC.\"  THIS\nINVOLVES HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO, TOGETHER, MAKE UP A SIZABLE QUANTITY\nOF DRUGS EVERY DAY.\n\n   THE CARS ARE THE HARD CURRENCY USED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS.  MOST OF\nTHEM ARE TAKEN TO BOLIVIA AFTER HAVING BEEN STOLEN IN SAO PAULO.  THEY\nFOLLOW THE SAME ROUTE AS THE BOLIVIAN COCAINE, THAT IS, VIA PUERTO\nSUAREZ.  THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE TRAFFICKING, HOWEVER, IS\nCARRIED OUT IN PARAGUAY AND BOLIVIA.  GERSON PALERMO IS RESPONSIBLE\nFOR PART OF IT, WHILE THE REST IS SHARED BY HUNDREDS OF BOLIVIAN\nTRAFFICKERS.  PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE FROM FORMOSA,\nARGENTINA.  HE TAKES THESE CHEMICALS ABOARD SMALL PLANES TO THE TOWNS\nOF PILAR OR ENCARNACION, IN PARAGUAY. FROM THERE, ANOTHER GROUP TAKES\nTHE 200-LITER DRUMS ALONG THE CHACO HIGHWAY TO PUERTO GUARANI, IN\nBOLIVIA.  BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF THE JOURNEY TO\nSANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA.  IN RETURN, PALERMO RECEIVES COCAINE PASTE\nWHICH IS SHIPPED TO ASUNCION AND, FROM THERE, TO PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO\nFOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESSING UNITS.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE\nTRAFFICKERS USE SOME RANCHES NEAR PORTO MURTINHO (MATO GROSSO DE SUL),\nNEAR THE PARAGUAYAN TOWN OF BAHIA NEGRA, TO PROCESS LARGE QUANTITIES\nOF COCAINE.\n\n   NO COCAINE PASTE IS USUALLY AVAILABLE ALONG THE CORUMBA ROUTE.  THE\nDRUG IS REFINED BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVELY EASY TO FIND ETHER AND\nACETONE IN CORUMBA, WHERE THE FEDERAL POLICE HAVE FAILED TO REDUCE THE\nLARGE DEMAND FOR SUCH CHEMICALS IN RETAIL STORES.  DOZENS OF\nDRUGSTORES SELL THOSE PRODUCTS BY THE LITER, AND THIS IS NOT FORBIDDEN\nBY LAW.\n\n   THE AUTHORITIES ESTIMATE THAT PRODUCTION IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ\nREGION NEARS 300 KG PER WEEK, WHICH IS TRANSPORTED BY RAILROAD, AIR,\nAND LAND.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO EVADE THE FEDERAL POLICE, TRAFFICKERS HAVE\nTRIED TO TRANSPORT THE DRUG INSIDE THEIR BODIES, IN WINE DEMIJOHNS,\nAND EVEN IN CHILDREN'S DIAPERS.  THESE TRAFFICKERS GENERALLY TRAVEL BY\nBUS OR BY TRAIN. OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS THE POLICE CAUGHT DOZENS OF\nTRAFFICKERS USING THESE METHODS.  NOW, HOWEVER, ONLY WITH THE\nCOMPLICITY OF THE POLICE CAN CARS CARRYING BOLIVIAN COCAINE PRODUCED\nIN THE PUERTO SUAREZ REGION REACH CAMPO GRANDE.  ",

HOWEVER, I WANT TO TELL YOU VERY\nHONESTLY, THAT I AM PERHAPS BETTER AT SELLING DREAMS, IDEAS, AND\nDOCTRINES THAN AT ADMINISTERING A SITUATION OF PENURY, LIKE THE ONE\nOUR COUNTRIES ARE EXPERIENCING, AND MOST PARTICULARLY PERU, WHICH IS\nONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.\nFOR INSTANCE, ON A DAY WHEN THE PRICE OF RICE OR CHICKEN GOES UP, THE\nPEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU, EVEN IF YOU TELL THEM THE GREATEST OF\nTRUTHS.  ONE CAN BE PREACHING SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, BUT IF IT\nFAILED TO RAIN AND THE CITY HAD NO WATER NO ONE WILL BELIEVE OF YOU\nTHE GREATEST OF ALL TRUTHS.  THEN, WHEN ONE STOPS BEING PRESIDENT AND\nADMINISTERING PENURY, ONE CAN DEVOTE ONESELF TO CONVINCING PEOPLE, TO\nEDUCATING.  THAT IS WHAT I SHOULD DO.\n\n   [AMAT] NOW, WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT ASIDE, MAKING ME PRESIDENT OF ALL\nPERUVIANS, EVEN OF VARGAS LLOSA?  WHETHER HE LIKES OR NOT IT HURTS\nHIM.\n\n   [GARCIA] BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE\nME AS PRESIDENT.  [LAUGHTER]\n\n   [AMAT] EVEN HIM, FOR INSTANCE?\n\n   [GARCIA] I DID NOT SAY SO.  I DO NOT KNOW.  I NEVER FALL TO THE\nLEVEL OF DEFINING PEOPLE OR POINTING OUT LAST NAMES.  I MAKE AN\nOUTLINE OR DEFINE THEM IN THE NEGATIVE.\n\n   [AMAT] MR. PRESIDENT, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THIS DIALOGUE [WORDS\nINDISTINCT] FOR YOUR GENEROSITY AND KINDNESS.  ADDRESSING OUR PEOPLE\nAND OUR COUNTRY, [WORDS INDISTINCT], HOW WERE THINGS TODAY AT THE\nSUMMIT?\n\n   [GARCIA] VERY WELL.  COLOMBIANS, WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR INSTITUTION\nTHREATENED, THEIR PRESS ABUSED, AND MANY POLITICIANS ALSO THREATENED,\nMUST HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT LATIN AMERICA, TOGETHER WITH THE UNITED\nSTATES, WILL CONFRONT THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THIS IS NOT\nONLY A PROBLEM FOR COLOMBIA.  IT IS OUR PROBLEM TOO, AND WE WILL\nTACKLE IT.  THE DAY A NEWSPAPER WAS BLOWN UP IN BOGOTA I CAME TO\nBOGOTA BECAUSE I FELT THAT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS WAS THREATENED ON THE\nCONTINENT.  AFTER ALL, WE ARE LATIN AMERICANS.  LET COLOMBIANS HAVE\nCONFIDENCE.  ",

A REPORT SAYS THAT A DMIFA ARMED FORCES ENGINEERS'\nMILITARY DETACHMENT UNIT WAS AT SANTA TERESA HOSPITAL, AND THAT THE\nENTIRE UNIT WAS WIPED OUT.  THE SOLDIERS HAD A COMMUNICATIONS RELAY\nSTATION IN THE BUILDING. AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACK, THERE WERE 20\nCASUALTIES. AMONG THE CASUALTIES IS A LIEUTENANT WHO WAS THE UNIT\nCHIEF, AND TWO SERGEANTS. THE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT WAS TOTALLY\nDESTROYED.\n\n   THE SITUATION IS NOT AS THE FASCIST CRISTIANI REPORTED IT TO BE.  HE\nSAID THERE WAS ONLY ONE SOLDIER AT THE HOSPITAL RECEIVING MEDICAL\nTREATMENT. THAT IS TOTALLY FALSE. THE BUILDING HOUSED A GARRISON NOT A\nHOSPITAL, BECAUSE A DMIFA UNIT AND A COMMUNICATIONS RELAY CENTER WERE\nTHERE. IT WAS A GARRISON.\n\n   WE ARE GOING TO CORRECT OUR REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THE ATTACK ON\nTHE DMIFA UNIT: 20 SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND 10 WERE WOUNDED.  IN ALL,\nTHERE WERE 30 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING TWO SERGEANTS AND THE UNIT CHIEF.\nWE REPEAT: IN AN IMPRESSIVE ATTACK ON A MILITARY POSITION AT SANTA\nTERESA HOSPITAL--THE BUILDING WAS NO LONGER A HOSPITAL BUT AN ARMY\nCOMMUNICATIONS CENTER--OUR FIGTHTERS ANNIHILATED AND DESTROYED THAT\nPOSITION. THE ARMY SUSTAINED 20 KILLED AND 10 WOUNDED. THE\nCOMMUNICATIONS RELAY STATION WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED.",

PRESIDENT, THE NEWSPAPER LA JORNADA OF MEXICO STATED\nYESTERDAY THAT COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY THIS\nWEEKEND WITH ALL HIS FAMILY AND WITH A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LUGGAGE,\nWHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT HE DID NOT GO ON A MERE VACATION.  I WOULD\nLIKE TO KNOW THE OFFICIAL VERSION OF THIS. [LAUGHTER]\n\n   [CRISTIANI] YOU SAY HE LEFT WHEN?\n\n   [REPORTER] YESTERDAY.\n\n   [CRISTIANI] WELL, ONLY IF HE LEFT VERY HURRIEDLY AFTER MIDDAY.  I\nWAS WITH HIM HERE YESTERDAY DISCUSSING OTHER THINGS, AS WELL AS\nMILITARY MATTERS WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTER AND DEPUTY MINISTERS.  HE\nWAS PRESENT.  UNLESS HE MAY HAVE LEFT.  I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH, BECAUSE\nI HAD A MEETING WITH THEM TO SEE THE ORDER OF THE MONTH ON SATURDAY\nAND HE WAS PRESENT.  PARDON ME, THAT WAS TUESDAY WHEN WE HAD THE ORDER\nFOR THE END OF THE MONTH.  I UNDERSTAND HE WAS PRESENT AT THE\nCOMMANDERS MEETING.  IF HE LEFT LAST WEEKEND, IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR\nTHE WEEKEND AND HE RETURNED ON MONDAY.\n\n   [MODERATOR] MARIA CORTINA, NOTIMEX.\n\n   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, IN WHAT WAY WOULD A CUT IN MILITARY AID\nAFFECT THE PEACE PROCESS?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEING OPPOSITE SIGNS FROM THE FMLN IN\nTERMS OF WANTING TO TRULY PUT AN END TO VIOLENCE.  A SIGN OF THIS WAS\nTHE NIGHT OF 1 MAY WHEN THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT.  THIS WOULD\nINDICATE THAT, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL THE FMLN COMMAND, THAT IS THE FIVE\nGROUPS, SOME GROUPS SEEM TO RESIST A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND FAVOR A\nMILITARY SOLUTION, AS THEY HAVE INSISTED ON PURSUING FOR 10 YEARS.\nTHOSE GROUPS COULD VIEW A CUT IN MILITARY AID AS A SIGN OF WEAKENING\nOF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THEY\nWOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BEING SUCCESSFUL FOLLOWING THE MILITARY\nPATH.  THAT COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL OF A MILITARY SOLUTION IN THE\nMINDS OF SOME.  THIS COULD REDUCE THE POTENTIAL OF SERIOUSLY\nCONSIDERING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.\n\n   [MODERATOR] RAUL MONGE, CADENA RADIO CENTRO.\n\n   [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, HOW DO YOU VIEW THE GUERRILLAS' MORALE AT\nTHIS MOMENT?\n\n   [CRISTIANI] WELL, I OBVIOUSLY CANNOT BUT BELIEVE THAT THE MORALE OF\nTHE GUERRILLAS AFTER THE OFFENSIVE MUST HAVE DROPPED CONSIDERBLY.\nTHIS IS ESPECIALLY SO SINCE THERE WAS A LARGE SACRIFICE ON THEIR PART\nIN THE FORM OF CASUALTIES AND THE FACT THAT THE OFFENSIVE DID NOT\nREPRESENT A SUCCESS, DESPITE THEIR CLAIM THAT IT WAS ONLY A SHOW OF\nFORCE, WHICH IS A LOT OF MALARKEY.  ALL THE PRIOR DOCUMENTS INDICATED\nTHAT THIS WAS A LARGE-SCALE OPERATION TO THE HILT SEEKING TO OVERTHROW\nTHE GOVERNMENT AND TO CROWN A MILITARY VICTORY.  WHAT I BELIEVE WAS OF\nEVEN GREATER IMPACT WAS THAT THEY REALIZED THAT THE PEOPLE OF EL\nSALVADOR DO NOT SUPPORT THEM AND DO NOT SUPPORT THE PATH OF VIOLENCE.\nIN THAT SENSE, THEIR HOPES OF A POPULAR INSURRECTION WERE SHATTERED.\nON THE CONTRARY, THE PEOPLE DID NOT SUPPORT THE FMLN AND INSTEAD\nTURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM AND SHOWED THAT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT\nVIOLENCE.  THIS MUST HAVE CAUSED AN IMPACT ON THE FMLN AND ITS\nMEMBERS.  I RECENTLY READ IN A VENEZUELAN NEWSPAPER STATEMENTS BY A\nCOMMANDER, WHOSE PSEUDONYM IS GUSTAVO, WHO SAID THAT THEY WERE TIRED\nOF FOLLOWING THE PATH OF VIOLENCE AND THAT A SOLUTION HAD TO BE FOUND.\nTHIS DEMONSTRATES THAT SOME OF THEIR RANKS ARE GETTING TIRED OF THE\nMILITARY PATH.  THESE ARE INDICATIONS OF WHAT COULD BE.  WHAT I WANT\nTO CLEAR UP ONCE AND FOR ALL IS THAT WE DO NOT REACT TO WHETHER OR NOT\nTHE FMLN FEELS STRONG OR FEELS WEAK.  WE KNOW THAT 100 TERRORISTS IN A\nCOUNTRY CAN CAUSE DESTRUCTION AND DEATH AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING\nTO AVOID, ALTHOUGH 100 TERRORISTS ARE NOT A FORCE THAT WILL\nDESTABILIZE A GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THE DAMAGE THAT THEY CAUSE IS SUCH\nTHAT WE DO NOT WANT IT TO CONTINUE.  [CONTINUED]",

      "text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 6 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH\nCOLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF OF\nTHE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, BY UNIDENTIFIED SALVADORAN AND\nINTERNATIONAL REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] COLONEL, WHAT\nSPECIFIC MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN AGAINST THE MISSILES?\n\n   [PONCE] I BELIEVE THAT SPECIFIC MEASURES WE HAVE ADOPTED HAVE GIVEN\nUS GOOD RESULTS.  THEY HAVE LAUNCHED FOUR SA-7'S IN THE ZACATECOLUCA\nAREA; HOWEVER, OUR PILOTS HAVE SKILLFULLY AVOIDED THE ROCKETS OR\nMISSILES, WHICH DID NOT HIT THEIR AIRCRAFT.  WE ARE ADOPTING MEASURES\nTHAT ARE GIVING RESULTS.  WE MUST ALSO CLARIFY THAT WE FEEL THAT SINCE\nTHE LIGHT AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING THESE MISSILES DID NOT HAVE A NORMAL\nLANDING AND THE MISSILES WERE NOT IN THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGE, IT IS\nPOSSIBLE THAT THEY SUFFERED SOME FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE WHEN THE PLANE\nCRASHED SOUTH OF ZACATECOLUCA.  THANK GOD, [WORDS INDISTINCT]\n\n   [REPORTER] DO YOU THINK THAT THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN\nPRESIDENTS CAN OPEN NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR RESUMING TALKS WITH THE\nFMLN?  DO YOU THINK THAT THIS SUMMIT COULD BRING ABOUT NEW STEPS\nTOWARD A DIALOGUE?\n\n   [PONCE] YES, I THINK THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SINCE THE\nBEGINNING OF THE YEAR HAS OPENED THIS POSSIBILITY AND IS WILLING TO\nTALK ON A PERMANENT BASIS.  I THINK THAT AT THIS TIME IT WOULD BE A\nPOSITIVE STEP IN THE POLITICAL FIELD.\n\n   HOWEVER, IN THE MILITARY FIELD, WHERE THE FMLN HAS ATTACKED US IN\nAN IRRATIONAL AND VIOLENT WAY IN THE MAIN CITIES, THE ARMED FORCES IS\nREPLYING, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO REPLY.  WE WILL COMPLETELY DEFEAT\nTHE FMLN.\n\n   BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR UNITS, WE HAVE\nINFLICTED 1,902 DEAD, 1,209 WOUNDED, AND 44 TERRORISTS HAVE DESERTED\nAND TURNED THEMSELVES IN TO THE AUTHORITIES.  WE HAVE CONFISCATED A\nLARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS.  I WILL GIVE YOU THE QUANTITIES: 25\nANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES -- ONE RED EYE AND 24 SA-7'S -- 915 RIFLES, 12\nCARBINES, 11 SHOTGUNS, 156 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 49 MORTARS,\n45 MACHINEGUNS, 41 SUBMACHINEGUNS, 67 REVOLVERS AND PISTOLS, 23\nRADIOS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES.\n\n   I MUST STRESS THAT THE FMLN HAS GATHERED ALL THESE WEAPONS WITH\nSUPPPORT FROM ABROAD.  IT IS A LARGE ARSENAL.\n\n   I MUST ALSO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE WEAPONS WE FOUND HAD BEEN\nABANDONED, WHICH MEANS THAT THE FMLN HAS HAD MANY DESERTIONS.  WE HAVE\nALSO FOUND WEAPONS IN HOUSES, THANKS TO THE COLLABORATION OF THE\nCIVILIAN POPULATION.\n\n   WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE FMLN HAS KIDNAPPED A LARGE NUMBER OF\nYOUTHS HERE IN THE SAN SALVADOR AREA AND MAINLY IN USULUTAN, AS WELL\nAS IN CHALATENANGO.  THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO FILL IN THE\nNUMBER OF CASUALTIES THEY HAVE SUFFERED WITH YOUTHS.  THIS ALSO MEANS\nTHAT THEIR EFFICIENCY WILL BE VERY LOW.\n\n   [REPORTER] I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS A\nLEAFLET ISSUED BY THE AIR FORCE, WHICH WAS DROPPED FROM AIRPLANES AND\nALSO DISTRIBUTED ON THE STREETS.  THE LEAFLET URGES SALVADORAN\nPATRIOTS TO DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND, THEIR PROPERTIES, AND LIVES.  IT\nALSO SAYS THAT IF NECESSARY, TERRORISTS MUST BE KILLED, AS WELL AS\nTHEIR INTERNATIONALIST ALLIES.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THIS LEAFLET?\nIS IT NOT AN INVITATION TO KILL FOREIGNERS IN THIS COUNTRY?\n\n   [PONCE] I DO NOT THINK SO, BECAUSE THE LEAFLETS MENTION\nINTERNATIONALISTS, WHO ARE FIGHTING ALONG WITH THE FMLN.

      "text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 6 DEC 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH\nCOLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF OF\nTHE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, BY UNIDENTIFIED SALVADORAN AND\nINTERNATIONAL REPORTERS] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [REPORTER] COLONEL, WHAT\nSPECIFIC MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN AGAINST THE MISSILES?\n\n   [PONCE] I BELIEVE THAT SPECIFIC MEASURES WE HAVE ADOPTED HAVE GIVEN\nUS GOOD RESULTS.  THEY HAVE LAUNCHED FOUR SA-7'S IN THE ZACATECOLUCA\nAREA; HOWEVER, OUR PILOTS HAVE SKILLFULLY AVOIDED THE ROCKETS OR\nMISSILES, WHICH DID NOT HIT THEIR AIRCRAFT.  WE ARE ADOPTING MEASURES\nTHAT ARE GIVING RESULTS.  WE MUST ALSO CLARIFY THAT WE FEEL THAT SINCE\nTHE LIGHT AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING THESE MISSILES DID NOT HAVE A NORMAL\nLANDING AND THE MISSILES WERE NOT IN THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGE, IT IS\nPOSSIBLE THAT THEY SUFFERED SOME FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE WHEN THE PLANE\nCRASHED SOUTH OF ZACATECOLUCA.  THANK GOD, [WORDS INDISTINCT]\n\n   [REPORTER] DO YOU THINK THAT THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN\nPRESIDENTS CAN OPEN NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR RESUMING TALKS WITH THE\nFMLN?  DO YOU THINK THAT THIS SUMMIT COULD BRING ABOUT NEW STEPS\nTOWARD A DIALOGUE?\n\n   [PONCE] YES, I THINK THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SINCE THE\nBEGINNING OF THE YEAR HAS OPENED THIS POSSIBILITY AND IS WILLING TO\nTALK ON A PERMANENT BASIS.  I THINK THAT AT THIS TIME IT WOULD BE A\nPOSITIVE STEP IN THE POLITICAL FIELD.\n\n   HOWEVER, IN THE MILITARY FIELD, WHERE THE FMLN HAS ATTACKED US IN\nAN IRRATIONAL AND VIOLENT WAY IN THE MAIN CITIES, THE ARMED FORCES IS\nREPLYING, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO REPLY.  WE WILL COMPLETELY DEFEAT\nTHE FMLN.\n\n   BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR UNITS, WE HAVE\nINFLICTED 1,902 DEAD, 1,209 WOUNDED, AND 44 TERRORISTS HAVE DESERTED\nAND TURNED THEMSELVES IN TO THE AUTHORITIES.  WE HAVE CONFISCATED A\nLARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS.  I WILL GIVE YOU THE QUANTITIES: 25\nANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES -- ONE RED EYE AND 24 SA-7'S -- 915 RIFLES, 12\nCARBINES, 11 SHOTGUNS, 156 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 49 MORTARS,\n45 MACHINEGUNS, 41 SUBMACHINEGUNS, 67 REVOLVERS AND PISTOLS, 23\nRADIOS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES.\n\n   I MUST STRESS THAT THE FMLN HAS GATHERED ALL THESE WEAPONS WITH\nSUPPPORT FROM ABROAD.  IT IS A LARGE ARSENAL.\n\n   I MUST ALSO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE WEAPONS WE FOUND HAD BEEN\nABANDONED, WHICH MEANS THAT THE FMLN HAS HAD MANY DESERTIONS.  WE HAVE\nALSO FOUND WEAPONS IN HOUSES, THANKS TO THE COLLABORATION OF THE\nCIVILIAN POPULATION.\n\n   WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE FMLN HAS KIDNAPPED A LARGE NUMBER OF\nYOUTHS HERE IN THE SAN SALVADOR AREA AND MAINLY IN USULUTAN, AS WELL\nAS IN CHALATENANGO.  THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO FILL IN THE\nNUMBER OF CASUALTIES THEY HAVE SUFFERED WITH YOUTHS.  THIS ALSO MEANS\nTHAT THEIR EFFICIENCY WILL BE VERY LOW.\n\n   [REPORTER] I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS A\nLEAFLET ISSUED BY THE AIR FORCE, WHICH WAS DROPPED FROM AIRPLANES AND\nALSO DISTRIBUTED ON THE STREETS.  THE LEAFLET URGES SALVADORAN\nPATRIOTS TO DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND, THEIR PROPERTIES, AND LIVES.  IT\nALSO SAYS THAT IF NECESSARY, TERRORISTS MUST BE KILLED, AS WELL AS\nTHEIR INTERNATIONALIST ALLIES.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THIS LEAFLET?\nIS IT NOT AN INVITATION TO KILL FOREIGNERS IN THIS COUNTRY?\n\n   [PONCE] I DO NOT THINK SO, BECAUSE THE LEAFLETS MENTION\nINTERNATIONALISTS, WHO ARE FIGHTING ALONG WITH THE FMLN.

[END RECORDING]\n\n   HE ALSO SAID ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES READILY AVAILABLE TO THE FMLN IS TO\nPARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS FOR DELEGATES TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN\nPARLIAMENT.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] EL SALVADOR HAS PROPOSED AT THE LEGISLATIVE\nASSEMBLY TO RATIFY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT PROTOCOL.  THIS WOULD\nOPEN THE DOOR FOR THE SPECIAL ELECTION OF THE SALVADORAN DELEGATES TO THE\nPARLIAMENT.  IF A TRULY DEMOCRATIC WILLINGNESS BY THE FMLN EXISTS, THIS\nCOULD BE THEIR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE.  IT HAS NOT YET BEEN\nDECIDED WHETHER THIS ELECTION WILL BE HELD BEFORE THE 1991 OFFICIAL\nELECTIONS FOR MAYORS AND DEPUTIES.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN COULD\nJOINTLY CONSIDER THE ADVANTAGES OF A SPECIAL ELECTION THIS YEAR.  THEN WE\nCOULD MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE 1991 CONSTITUTIONAL ELECTIONS. [END\nRECORDING]\n\n   REGARDING THE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS, MERINO SAID THE GOVERNMENT IS\nFAMILIAR WITH THE REBELS' TACTICS, PARTICULARLY WHEN TALKS ARE BEING\nCONSIDERED.  HE ALSO SAID THE REBELS OPERATE IN CYCLES.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] THE GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER REACTED NAIVELY TO THE\nFMLN TERRORISTS' STATEMENTS OR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE.  WE ARE\nFULLY AWARE OF THEIR PLANS AND STRATEGIES.  THE GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, BEARS\nTHE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF SEEKING HARMONY AND THE CITIZENS'S SECURITY.\n[END RECORDING]\n\n   AFTER THE REBELS' COUNTEROFFENSIVE IN NOVEMBER, WHICH WAS REGARDED AS THE\nLARGEST MILITARY OPERATION IN THE PAST 10 YEARS, THE POSSIBILITY FOR A NEW\nDIALOGUE HAS APPEARED IN EL SALVADOR ONCE MORE, CREATING EXPECTATIONS, BOTH\nHERE AND ABROAD.  THE COMING MEETING OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI WITH UNITED\nNATION'S REPRESENTATIVES, SCHEDULED FOR NEXT WEEK, AND THE MEETING ON 12\nJANUARY OF A REBEL DELEGATION WITH A UNITED NATIONS OFFICIAL SEEM TO\nINDICATE THAT TALKS WILL BE HELD SHORTLY.",

THERE IS AN ESSENTIAL FACT:  A HARD\nBLOW HAS BEEN DEALT TO SUBVERSION WITH THE ARREST OF ONE OF ITS PRINCIPAL\nCHIEFTAINS--NOT A LEADER BUT A CHIEFTAIN.  PERU HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF\nBLOODY TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THERE CAN BE NO CONCESSIONS FOR TERRORISTS OTHER\nTHAN THOSE GRANTED BY THE LAW.  THIS FACT CANNOT BE DISPELLED BY AN\nANECDOTE LIKE THE ONE I READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS TODAY.  THE ESSENTIAL FACT\nIS THAT THIS ARREST [OF VICTOR POLAY CAMPOS] IS A MAJOR BLOW TO\nSUBVERSION.  IT WAS NOT MERELY GOOD LUCK, BUT IT WAS THE RESULT OF WORK\nAND FOLLOW-UP BY THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE\nPOLICE.  I BELIEVE THIS IS THE KEY POINT.  I HAVE SEEN THAT ATTENTION HAS\nBEEN GIVEN TO A VISIT [PAID BY PRIME MINISTER ARMANDO VILLANUEVA TO POLAY\nCAMPOS IN PRISON] WHICH WAS NEITHER A COURTESY VISIT NOR AN EXPRESSION OF\nSUPPORT, BUT JUST A SUPERVISORY ACT, GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FACTS.\nANOTHER OBJECTIVE OF THE VISIT, WHICH FOR SURE HAS ALREADY BEEN COMMENTED\nON BY SOME COMMUNIST POLITICIANS, WAS TO OBSERVE THE CONDITION OF THE\nDETAINEE.  THE VISIT DID NOT MEAN THAT THE DETAINEE WAS GRANTED SPECIAL\nSTATUS.  WE DO NOT GRANT SPECIAL STATUS TO ANYONE, MUCH LESS TO THESE\nMURDERERS WHO HAVE STAINED THE NATION WITH BLOOD.  THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE\nLAW MUST BE STRICTLY ENFORCED ON THESE INDIVIDUALS.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE\nVISIT BY PRIME MINISTER ARMANDO VILLANUEVA TO THE ANTITERRORIST\nDIRECTORATE DOES NOT MEAN THAT A DIALOGUE HAS BEGUN OR THAT SOMEONE IS\nBEING PRAISED, AS SOME ILL-INTENTIONED MASS MEDIA WILL PROBABLY SAY.\n[PASSAGE OMITTED]",

THE ONLY GOOD THING IS THAT AFTER THE ELECTIONS, WE ARE CLOSER\nTO DEFINING THE CONFLICT IN EL SALVADOR.\n\n   \"IT HAS BEEN A LONG AND DIFFICULT WAR.  THE ENEMY WAS ILL-DEFINED,\nENJOYING CERTAIN POPULARITY AMONG THE PEOPLE, MAKING IT EASIER FOR THEM TO\nTRY AND PERSUADE THEM THAT OUR REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE WAS A TERRORIST WAR\nWHEN THIS WAS NOT THE CASE.\"\n\n   ANA GUADALUPE MARTINEZ SAID:\n\n   \"I BELIEVE THAT THE EVENTS THAT BEGAN IN 1981 ARE COMING FULL CIRCLE\nNOW, BUT NOW THERE ARE MANY ADVANTAGES.\n\n   \"THE PDC EMERGED FROM A POPULAR STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DICTATORSHIP.  NOW\nTHEY ARE IN OPPOSITION AND CAN DEAL WITH THE REST OF THE OPPOSITION AS\nEQUALS, AND THAT IS AN ADVANTAGE FOR US.\n\n   \"THE SPLIT WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IS FOR THE BETTER.  I BELIEVE WE\nARE NOW IN THE FINAL STAGES.\"\n\n   WHEN MARTINEZ WAS ASKED HOW SHE WOULD DESCRIBE THE PDC'S ROLE IN EL\nSALVADOR DURING THE LAST 5 YEARS, SHE REPLIED:\n\n   \"THE PDC PLAYED A VERY NEGATIVE ROLE.  IT PROLONGED THE WAR THAT WOULD\nHAVE OTHERWISE BEEN VERY MUCH SHORTER, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PDC MAY\nDEVIATE FROM THEIR PAST BEHAVIOR AND PLAY A DIFFERENT ROLE THAN THE\nOPPOSITION, FAVORING A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.\"\n\n   THE FMLN COMMANDERS BELIEVED THAT ARENA'S VICTORY WILL BRING BACK THE\nDEATH SQUADS.  THE FMLN COMMANDERS BELIEVE THAT NOW THE POSSIBILITY OF A\nMILITARY COUP IS GREATER.\n\n   CONTRARY TO WHAT MIGHT BE BELIEVED, THE FMLN COMANDERS SAID:  \"WE DO\nNOT SEE A STRONG RIGHT WING.  WE SEE THEM MORE TRAPPED POLITICALLY AND\nECONOMICALLY.\"  THE COMMANDERS ALSO ARGUED THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO FACE\nTHE SAME OLIGARCHY AND ARMY THEY FACED IN 1979.\n\n   THE MESSAGE THEY HAVE FOR ARENA STATES:  \"SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED?  IS IT\nNOT ENOUGH TO HAVE LAUNCHED A MILITARY OFFENSIVE?\"\n\n   THE COMMANDERS SAID THAT, NEVERTHELESS, THE FMLN IS READY FOR A GREAT\nMILITARY EFFORT AND REITERATED THAT IF ANYTHING CLEARLY EMERGED DURING THE\nLAST 2 MONTHS, IT IS THAT \"WE ARE A POLITICAL MAJORITY IN EL SALVADOR.\"\n[PASSAGE OMITTED]",

THE PRESIDENTS RECEIVED FIRSTHAND INFORMATION ON THE PEACE\nPLAN AND ON THE RESULTS THE GOVERNMENT EXPECTS FROM THIS PROCESS [WORDS\nINDISTINCT].

HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE\nSANDINIST GOVERNMENT, CRISTIANI STATED.\n\n   CONCERNING THE RECENT ATTACKS BLAMED ON THE GUERRILLAS, PARTICULARLY\nTHE 30 OCTOBER ATTACK ON THE ARMY'S HIGH COMMAND, CRISTIANI SAID THIS IS\nREGRETTABLE BECAUSE CIVILIANS ARE MORE AFFECTED BY SUCH ATTACKS.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] THIS INCIDENT TAKES PLACE AT A TIME WHEN\nTHE FMLN IS TRYING TO SHOW ITS STRENGTH.  THE FMLN IS ALSO TRYING TO\nPROVOKE SOME REACTION FROM THE ARMED FORCES SO THAT THE ARMY, IN A GIVEN\nMOMENT, EXERTS PRESSURE TO SUSPEND THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.  I THINK THIS IS\nTHE REASON FOR THEIR ATTITUDE. [END RECORDING]\n\n   CRISTIANI ADDED THAT SUCH ATTITUDES WILL NOT HINDER THE DIALOGUE\nPROCESS IN VENEZUELA.  HE ADDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL WILL BE THE\nSAME PROPOSAL PRESENTED IN COSTA RICA AND IT WILL BE FULLY DISCUSSED.\nHOWEVER, THE PRIORITY WILL ALWAYS BE THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES.",

      "text": "   CLANDESTINE, 2 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH\nFARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT COMMANDER EDUARDO SANCHO,\nALIAS FERMAN CIENFUEGOS, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [BEGIN\nRECORDING] [REPORTER] COMRADE SANCHO, WHY HAS THE FMLN DECIDED NOT TO\nATTEND THE CARACAS MEETING?\n\n   [SANCHO] THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND INSTRUCTED ME THIS AFTERNOON TO\nANNOUNCE TO THE NATION A COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH WE DECIDED NOT TO ATTEND THE\nCARACAS MEETING AND DIALOGUE.  THE REASON FOR THIS IS THE RECENT FENASTRAS\nMASSACRE, WHICH WE BELIEVE CANNOT BE IGNORED.  THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER\nATTACK, LIKE THE ONES WE ARE USED TO, BUT AN ATTACK THAT SIGNALS A NEW\nPOLITICAL ERA SIMILAR TO THOSE WHEN AN ELECTORAL MASSACRE OCCURRED, WHEN\nMSGR ARNULFO ROMERO WAS MURDERED, WHEN OTHER CRIMES MARKED NEW STEPS IN THE\nNEW FASCIST ESCALATION OF THE DICTATORSHIP NOW LED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI,\nCOLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, AND THE GREAT EXECUTIONER AND PERPETRATOR OF\nMASSACRES, ELENA FUENTES.  THE MAIN THING IS THAT THE FASCIST MILITARY\nDICTATORSHIP, HEADED BY A SMALL ARMED FORCES GROUP, HAS BEEN EXPOSED.  WE\nDO NOT THINK THIS CAN BE IGNORED.  THE STATE AND [WORDS INDISTINCT] HAVE\nTO PAY A POLITICAL PRICE.  THIS PRICE IS COL PONCE'S RESIGNATION, WHICH IS\nNOW DEMANDED BY THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT.\n\n   [REPORTER] AFTER THE ATTACK, INSTEAD OF SEEKING A DETENTE, THE ARMY, ON\nTHE CONTRARY, CONTINUED ITS PROVOCATIONS.  FOR INSTANCE, SEVERAL\nPLAINCLOTHES MEMBERS OF THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE [WORDS INDISTINCT]\nFENASTRAS AND THE POPULAR MOVEMENT TOOK THEM PRISONER.  MORE THAN 30 OF\nTHEM WERE DETAINED.  WE LEARNED THIS AFTERNOON THAT THE POLICE RELEASED A\nCOMMUNIQUE SAYING THEY WOULD STATION ANTIRIOT POLICEMEN AT THE NATIONAL\nCEMETERY.  WE ALSO HEARD COL MAURICIO VARGAS SAYING THAT, IF THE DIALOGUE\nDOOR IS CLOSED, IT HAS TO BE KICKED OPEN.  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE\nSITUATION AFTER THE COWARDLY ATTACK ON FENASTRAS?\n\n   WE THINK ALL THESE ACTIVITIES OF THE DEATH SQUADS, THE 1ST INFANTRY\nBRIGADE, THE POLICE, AND THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE ONLY THE OPEN EXPRESSION\nOF THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION, WHICH IS TO PLAN A FULL-SCALE CONFRONTATION\nWITH THE POPULAR MOVEMENT.  WE THINK THIS INDICATES [WORDS INDISTINCT]\nBEHIND THE BACKS OF THE MAJORITY OF ARMED FORCES MEMBERS.  IT IS A\nMINORITY WHO HAVE DECIDED ON THESE PROVOCATIONS AGAINST THE POPULAR\nMOVEMENT.  THIS MOVEMENT, HOWEVER, IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO DISARM THESE\nPROVOCATEURS, PRESENT THEM TO THE PRESS, AND HAND THEM OVER TO SHOW THAT\nTHE PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR TREMENDOUS POWER WHENEVER THEY WANT.\n\n   [REPORTER] WITH LA TANDONA [REFERENCE TO 1966 GRADUATES OF THE CAPTAIN\nGERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY] IN POWER, AND WITH THE SITUATION THE\nARENA [NATIONAL REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] ERA HAS USHERED IN, IS THERE NO\nPOSSIBLE SOLUTION THROUGH DIALOGUE?  WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE DO YOU HAVE?\n\n   [SANCHO] I BELIEVE THAT IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND\nTHE HIGH COMMAND ARE PRACTICALLY DOING AWAY WITH POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES,\nAS OUR EARLIER COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AFTER THE FENASTRAS ATTACK INDICATES.\nTHE END RESULT IS THAT SINCE THERE IS NO POLITICAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH\nTO ESTABLISH A POLITICAL GAME WITH CERTAIN POLITICAL RULES FOR THE\nOPPOSITION AND STATE FORCES, OUR ONLY OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS TO IMMEDIATELY\nTAKE UP OUR WEAPONS, BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF GUARANTEEING THE\nSURVIVAL OF THE POPULAR MOVEMENT AND THE NATION.  THE PEOPLE'S LEGITIMATE\nRIGHT TO DEFENSE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, AND IT IS GAINING\nGREATER NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION.\n\n   [REPORTER] THE POPULAR MOVEMENT IS ONCE AGAIN FACING A DECISIVE MOMENT\nIN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY, AND THE WORKERS ARE GIVING THEIR SHARE OF BLOOD\nIN THIS STRUGGLE.  WHAT MESSAGE WOULD YOU SEND TO THE POPULAR MOVEMENT,\nESPECIALLY TO THE COMRADE WORKERS AT FENASTRAS?\n\n   [SANCHO] ON THIS OCCASION, I WISH TO SEND A SPECIAL MESSAGE TO\nFENASTRAS.  I MUST TELL THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE INSPIRED BY THE PUREST\nCONCEPTS OF THE POPULAR STRUGGLE, TO KEEP THEIR INSPIRATION, TO BE\nCREATIVE AND COOL, AND THAT WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN TO CREATE THEIR OWN HISTORY,\nTHEY ARE TRULY INVINCIBLE.\n\n   I BELIEVE THAT FENASTRAS HAS THE PEOPLE'S FULL SUPPORT AND THAT IT WILL\nGRADUALLY GAIN EVEN MORE SUPPORT.  FENASTRAS MUST CONTINUE--AS ITS LEADERS\nSAY--ON THE WARPATH.  IN REALITY, THE COST IN LIVES OF LEADERS SUCH AS FEBE\nELIZABETH AND ALL THE OTHERS WHO WERE KILLED, AS WELL AS THOSE KILLED IN\nTHE PAST, IS QUITE HIGH.  THE COST IS POLITICAL.  IT HAS TAKEN LIVES BUT\nTHIS, IN REALITY, STRENGTHENS THE ORGANIZATION.  THE PEOPLE'S RESPONSE HAS\nBEEN ONE OF ANGER AND DISCONTENT, AND THIS DISCONTENT WILL EVENTUALLY TURN\nINTO A CLAMOR FOR ARMED STRUGGLE BY SECTORS THAT REALLY [WORDS INDISTINCT]\nAND TO ACHIEVE OUR PEOPLE'S FREEDOM.

IF HE DID SAY\nIT, IT WOULD BE VERY SERIOUS, BECAUSE HE WOULD BE INTERVENING IN OUR\nDOMESTIC AFFAIRS.\"\n\n   BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT JOSE SARNEY RECENTLY SAID THAT THE CONSTRUCTION\nOF THE INTERNATIONAL HIGHWAY IS \"A MATTER OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY.\"\n\n   BRAZIL AND PERU ARE SPONSORING A PROJECT TO BUILD A HIGHWAY THROUGH\nTHE AMAZON REGION TO JOIN THE BRAZILIAN NORTHWESTERN STATE OF ACRE AND\nTHE PACIFIC OCEAN.  BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE ASKED FOR JAPAN'S FINANCIAL\nSUPPORT FOR THE PROJECT.\n\n   IN PRACTICE, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ESTABLISH A LAND CORRIDOR BETWEEN\nTHE ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC OCEANS--AN OLD PROJECT OF THE BRAZILIAN\nMILITARY GEOSTRATEGISTS.\n\n   THE BRAZILIAN MILITARY MINISTERS SUPPORTED SARNEY'S POSITION BY\nANNOUNCING THAT THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT \"ANY TYPE OF FOREIGN FOREIGN\nINTERFERENCE IN THE AMAZON REGION\" AND THAT THEY REJECTED AS\n\"UNACCEPTABLE\" THE ATTEMPTS TO LINK THE FOREIGN DEBT WITH INVESTMENTS\nTO PRESERVE THE AMAZON FOREST.\n\n   GARCIA INDICATED THAT IF THE UNITED STATES WANTS TO HELP PRESERVE\nTHE ECOLOGICAL BALANCE, IT SHOULD \"SPEED UP DISARMAMENT TALKS WITH THE\nSOVIET UNION.\"  HE ADDED THAT \"THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT THE AMAZON\nREGION IS TO ELIMINATE DEADLY WEAPONS AND NUCLEAR BOMBS.\"\n\n   GARCIA THEN REITERATED: \"I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAS\nSAID THAT, BUT IF HE SAID IT, I BELIEVE THAT IT IS A SERIOUS MATTER\nAND HE SHOULD GIVE US A CONCRETE OPINION.\"\n\n   GARCIA DEFENDED RELATIONS WITH BRAZIL BY SAYING: \"I BELIEVE\nFORTIFYING ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND GEOGRAPHIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO\nCOUNTRIES IS A NATIONAL OBJECTIVE.\"  THEN HE ADDED: \"BRAZIL IS ONE OF\nTHE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT COUNTRIES, AND PERU HAS WRONGLY LIVED IN\nFEAR OF BRAZIL.  LET US HOPE THAT NOT ONE BUT FIVE HIGHWAYS ARE BUILT\nTHROUGH THE AMAZON REGION.\"\n\n   SIXTY PERCENT OF PERU'S 1.3 MILLION SQUARE KILOMETERS LIE IN THE\nAMAZON REGION.  THAT MAKES UP NEARLY ONE-FIFTH OF THE ENTIRE AMAZON\nBASIN.",

RODRIGUEZ GACHA SENT COPIES OF THIS LETTER TO ALL MEDIA.\n\n   THE TEXT OF THE LETTER FOLLOWS:\n\nMR PASTRANA:\n\n   AN ARTICLE ON PAGE 1 OF YOUR 19 OCTOBER NEWSPAPER MAINTAINS THAT VERY\nRELIABLE SOURCES HAD DISCLOSED THAT JOSE GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA SENT A\nMESSAGE TO THE FARC LEADERS LAST WEEK PROPOSING AN ALLIANCE WITH THAT\nSUBVERSIVE GROUP.\n\n   THE TRUTH IS THAT SUCH A LETTER DOES NOT EXIST AND THAT I HAVE SENT NO\nMESSAGE TO ANY OF THE PEOPLE MENTIONED IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.\n\n   HOWEVER, THE WORST PART OF THIS IS THAT THE EVIL INTENTION OF THE\nALLEGED WRITERS OF THE LETTER REACHES THE LIMIT BECAUSE THEY PORTRAY ME AS\nTHE SELF-CONFESSED CULPRIT OF ALL CRIMES PERPETRATED AGAINST UP [PATRIOTIC\nUNION] LEADERS.  IT IS TRUE I WAS ACCUSED OF THE [FORMER UP LEADER JAIME]\nPARDO LEAL ASSASSINATION.  HOWEVER, THE COURTS HAVE ALREADY ISSUED A\nVERDICT OF NOT GUILTY.  NO MAN HAS EVER BEEN PURSUED IN COLOMBIA WITH SUCH\nMALICE.  IT SEEMS THAT THE ENTIRE PENAL CODE HAS FALLEN UPON ME, WHILE MY\nOPPONENTS ARE COMPLETELY IGNORED.\n\n   REGARDING THE REST OF THE LETTER, IT DOES NOT EVEN DESERVE MENTIONING\nBECAUSE SUCH A LETTER DOES NOT EXIST.  THEREFORE, EVERYTHING IS FALSE.\nMOREOVER, ALL SECTORS ARE FULLY AWARE OF MY PRINCIPLES AND MY STRUGGLE\nTOWARD THE SO-CALLED FARC GROUPS.\n\n   I CLEARLY WANT TO STRESS MY AGREEMENT WITH THE PROPOSALS MADE BY THE\nM-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT], ESPECIALLY THOSE DEALING WITH CEASING OFFENSIVE\nOPERATIONS AGAINST THE ARMED FORCES AND THE DEFINITE LAYING DOWN OF\nWEAPONS.  THESE ARE THE FIRST STEPS TOWARD MAKING COLOMBIA SIT AT THE\nNEGOTIATING TABLE, WITH NO EXCLUSIONS.\n\n   THIS IS MY POSITION, AND THIS IS THE TRUTH.  I AM AWARE THAT THE\nMISSION OF EACH ONE OF YOU, AS COLOMBIANS, IS TO BRING PEACE BACK TO\nCOLOMBIA.\n\n   YOURS FAITHFULLY,\n\n   JOSE GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA",

THIS OCCURRED ON 18 MAY.\n\n   THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WERE HURLED FROM AN AUTOMOBILE.  IT DESTROYED\nAN ENTRANCE AND WINDOWS OF THE HOME AS WELL AS TRUSHIN'S CAR.\nHOWEVER, NEITHER TRUSHIN NOR HIS WIFE WERE INJURED.\n\n   THE COMMUNIQUE BY ESA, A PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT EMERGED IN\nTHE 1960'S, ADDS THAT IT \"WILL NOT REST UNTIL THE COMMUNIST AGGRESSION\nHAS BEEN STOPPED AND ITS DEFEAT ACHIEVED.\"\n\n   IT ALSO SAYS THAT \"THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IS PROMOTING REVOLUTION.\nIF IT WANTS WAR, IT WILL HAVE WAR BECAUSE WE ARE READY TO DIE AND TO\nFIGHT AGAINST COMMUNISM ANY TIME.\"\n\n   THE DOCUMENT, SIGNED BY COMMANDERS \"UBICO TOROKZIK\" AND \"RAFAEL\nNETANAGIUHI,\" SAYS THAT DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HECTOR GRAMEJO,\nFOREIGN MINISTER ALFONSO CABRERA, AND PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO\nPLANNED THE COUP.\n\n   ACCORDING TO THIS COMMUNIQUE, IN THE RECENT TRIP TO CUBA BY RAQUEL\nBLANDON, WIFE OF PRESIDENT CEREZO AREVALO, SHE MET WITH LIBYAN AHMAD\nMUSTAFA [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] \"TO ASK HIM FOR ECONOMIC SUPPORT FOR\nTHE NEXT GENERAL ELECTIONS IN 1990.\"\n\n   ESA IS OPPOSED TO THE ISSUANCE OF ARREST WARRANTS AGAINST MARIO\nDAVID GARCIA, DANILO ROCA, NICOLAS BUONAFINA, GUSTAVO ANZUETO VIELMAN,\nAND MARIO CASTEJON.  THESE ARE THE CIVILIANS WHOM THE CEREZO AREVALO\nGOVERNMENT HAS ACCUSED OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP ATTEMPT.\n\n   THIS GROUP STRESSES THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS A \"PLOY PROMOTED BY GEN\nHECTOR GRAMEJO.  THAT IS THE BASEST THING THAT THE DEFENSE MINISTER\nCOULD HAVE DONE: TO SELL HIMSELF AND HIS MILITARY COLLEAGUES.\"\n\n   ESA MEMBERS DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS \"GUATEMALA'S PROGRESSIVE\nPATRIOTS,\" AND THEY REAFFIRM THAT THE ATTACK ON THE TASS MISSION \"WAS\nA WARNING.\"",

THE COMMAND ISSUED THE FOLLOWING OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE:\n\n   1. AT 2300 ON 23 [AS HEARD] MAY, NEAR CAYARA, VICTOR FAJARDO\nPROVINCE, AYACUCHO DEPARTMENT, A GROUP OF APPROXIMATELY 100\nSUBVERSIVES AMBUSHED A TWO-VEHICLE ARMY PATROL ON A RELIEF OPERATION\nBETWEEN THE TOWNS OF SAN PEDRO DE GUAILLAS AND HUANCAPI.\n\n   2. THE FOLLOWING MEMBERS OF THE PERUVIAN ARMY DIED AS A RESULT OF\nTHIS CRIMINAL ATTACK: CAPTAIN JOSE URBULU SIMO, SECOND SERGEANT ANGEL\nVARGAS SAMARA, AND CORPORALS FAVIAN ROLDAN ORTIZ AND CARLOS ESPINOZA\nDE LA CRUZ.  FIFTEEN ARMY PERSONNEL WERE ALSO WOUNDED DURING THE\nATTACK, FOUR OF THEM SERIOUSLY.  THE CAPTAIN AND OTHER PERSONNEL KILLED\nDURING THE OPERATION WERE BURIED ON 16 MAY IN LIMA AND HUARAS,\nRESPECTIVELY.\n\n   THE ARMY PERSONNEL KILLED SIX UNIDENTIFIED SUBVERSIVES WHILE\nREPELLING THE ATTACK.  THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT AN UNSPECIFIED\nNUMBER OF SUBVERSIVES WERE ALSO WOUNDED.\n\n   3. PERUVIAN ARMY REINFORCEMENT PATROLS PURSUED THE SUBVERSIVE\nCOLUMN, WHICH TOOK FLIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF CAYARA.  THE PATROL FOUND\nTHE TOWN COMPLETELY EMPTY AND ABANDONED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME\nCHILDREN AND OLD PEOPLE WHO REPORTED THAT FOUR DEAD BODIES WERE LEFT\nIN THE TOWN'S CHURCH.\n\n   4. DURING THE SEARCH OPERATION AROUND CAYARA, THE PATROLS CLASHED\nWITH SUBVERSIVES AND KILLED AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER.\n\n   5. ON 16 MAY THE POLITICAL-MILITARY COMMAND REPORTED THE ATTACK TO\nTHE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IN AYACUCHO AND ASKED THE COURT TO INTERVENE.\nTHE PERUVIAN ARMY HAS ALSO BEGUN AN INQUIRY INTO THE MATTER.\n\n   6. THE FALSE REPORT BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES OF THE KILLING OF A LARGE\nNUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM CAYARA IS COMPLETELY GROUNDLESS.  THE REPORT OF\nAN ALLEGED BOMBARDMENT IS ALSO FALSE.  ALL THIS HAS THE SOLE PURPOSE OF\nHINDERING THE ACTION OF THE FORCES OF ORDER WHO ARE TRYING TO CAPTURE\nTHE CRIMINAL SUBVERSIVES WHO AMBUSHED THE ARMY PATROL.\n\n   7. THE SEARCH OPERATION CONTINUES AND THE RESULTS WILL BE REPORTED\nAS SOON AS THEY BECOME KNOWN.\n\n   LIMA, 18 MAY 1988\n\n   [SIGNED] PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE, NATIONAL CENTER SECURITY ZONE\nCOMMAND",

THE CEREMONY, HELD AT THE NATIONAL PARTY\nHEADQUARTERS IN THE OLD AND VENERABLE FERNANDEZ CONCHA CLUB, WAS\nPRESIDED OVER BY SERGIO ONOFRE JARPA, PATRICIO PHILLIPS, AND JAIME\nTORMO.\n\n   DURING THE CEREMONY, RADICAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY HEAD JAIME TORMO SAID THAT\nTHE THREE PARTIES WILL NOW START ANALYZING THEIR COMMON POSITIONS, UNDER THE\nEFFECTIVE COORDINATION OF NATIONAL RENEWAL SECRETARY ANDRES ALLAMAND.\n\n   JORGE MARTINEZ, OF THE NATIONAL PARTY THEN READ A JOINT DECLARATION.\nTHE THREE PARTIES REPORTED THAT ONE OF THEIR GOALS IS TO RESTORE THE\nMIDDLE CLASS'S DIGNITY AND ITS OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOBS, BECAUSE THIS CLASS\nHAS ALWAYS BEEN THE GREATEST SPONSOR OF NATIONAL INTELLECTUAL, MATERIAL,\nAND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT.\n\n   ANOTHER GOAL IS TO PREVENT THE COALITION FROM BECOMING A SUPER PARTY OR\nMERGING WITH OTHER PARTIES. THIS COALITION WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AS SUCH,\nAND ITS OBJECTIVE IS TO PROMOTE COOPERATION, BOTH AMONG MEMBER PARTIES AND\nWITH PARTIES THAT MAY WANT TO JOIN THEM IN THE FUTURE.\n\n   THE FIRST OFFICIAL ACT OF THE CENTER-RIGHT POLITICAL COALITION WAS TO\nSEND A CABLE TO U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH TO POINT OUT THE SERIOUS\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE MEASURES THE UNITED STATES HAS ADOPTED AGAINST CHILEAN\nFRUITS.  \n\n   THE CABLE, WHICH WAS READ BY ANDRES ALLAMAND, STATED:\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] IN VIEW OF THE GROUNDLESS AND EXAGGERATED MEASURES\nTAKEN BY SOME MEMBERS OF YOUR ADMINISTRATION AGAINST CHILEAN FRUIT EXPORTS,\nWE CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THESE MEASURES WILL RUIN A LARGE\nSECTOR OF CHILEAN PRIVATE ENTEPRISE, WILL LEAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF\nWORKERS JOBLESS, AND WILL CAUSE A SERIOUS IMBALANCE IN OUR BALANCE OF\nPAYMENTS. THESE MEASURES WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE GOOD RELATIONS THE\nCHILEAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS HAD WITH THE U.S. PEOPLE, AND THEY WILL DEEPLY\nINJURE THOSE WHO, LIKE US, DEFEND FREE ECONOMY AND FREE TRADE.\n\n   MOST SERIOUS, HOWEVER, IS THE FACT THAT THESE MEASURES APPARENTLY REWARD\nTHE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AGAINST CHILE, BECAUSE THEY HELP THE TERRORISTS\nACHIEVE THEIR GOALS. [END RECORDING] \n\n   THE CABLE ADDS THAT CHILE HAS EARNED JUSTIFIED PRESTIGE AS A SERIOUS AND\nEFFECTIVE EXPORTER; THAT IT HAS BEEN HONORING ITS FOREIGN DEBT AT A\nSACRIFICE; AND THAT IT HAS COOPERATED IN SEVERAL PUBLIC WELFARE PROJECTS\nSPONSORED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. IN VIEW OF ALL THAT, THE COALITION\nREQUESTS AN URGENT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.",

      "text": "   CLANDESTINE, 17 MAR 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]\n[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT]\nTHE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS DECIDED TO\nCOMBINE THE PEOPLE'S REJECTION OF THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS WITH AN\nINTENSIFICATION OF ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE NATION. THIS INCLUDES THE\nNATIONWIDE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE, WHICH WE NOW DECLARE TO BE\nINDEFINITE.\n\n   THE REJECTION OF THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS BY OUR PEOPLE AND THE IMPACT OF\nOUR ACTIONS HAVE LED THE REGIME TO LAUNCH A CAMPAIGN OF DISINFORMATION,\nAGGRESSION, AND THREATS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN A BID TO CONFUSE\nTHE POPULATION AND, IN ADDITION, TO SET THE STAGE FOR AN ELECTORAL FRAUD.\n\n   IN ORDER TO MAKE MATTERS CLEAR TO OUR PEOPLE AS WELL AS TO THE LOCAL AND\nINTERNATIONAL PRESS, WE REPORT THE FOLLOWING:\n\n   1.  THE GAGGING OF THE NATIONAL PRESS IS PART OF THE PLAN TO COVER UP THE\nFRAUD THAT WILL BE COMMITTED ON 19 MARCH.  IN ADDITION, THE CONTROL OVER THE\nMEDIA IS INTENDED TO ATTRIBUTE TERRORIST ACTIONS TO THE FMLN.\n\n   2.  THE REGIME HAS TRIED TO BLAME US FOR A NUMBER OF ACTIONS, SUCH AS THE\nATTACK ON A RED CROSS AMBULANCE, AMONG OTHERS, FOR THE SAME PURPOSE.  THE\nFMLN HAS A DEFINITE POLICY OF NOT HARMING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  THE\nHURLING OF GRENADES AT BUS STOPS IS A COMMON PRACTICE OF ARMY PERSONNEL AND\nIT IS THEREFORE PREPOSTEROUS TO BLAME THE FMLN.\n\n   3.  A NUMBER OF FALSE COMMUNIQUES WITH AN OBVIOUS TERRORIST TONE HAVE\nAPPEARED.  THEY CLUMSILY GLORIFY VIOLENCE AND THREATEN THE PRESS IN TERMS\nTHAT ARE QUITE UNLIKE THOSE APPEARING IN DOCUMENTS IN WHICH WE OUTLINE OUR\nOFFICIAL POSITION.  WE EMPHATICALLY STATE THAT THE FMLN HAS IN NO WAY OR AT\nANY TIME THREATENED THE PRESS OR THE CITIZENS.  WE RECALL THE FACT THAT OUR\nOFFICIAL COMMUNIQUES ARE SIGNED BY OUR GENERAL COMMAND AND BROADCAST THROUGH\nOUR STATIONS.\n\n   WE REITERATE THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL THING AT THIS TIME IS TO REINFORCE AND\nEXPAND UNITY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE THROUGH EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS.  THE\nSTRUGGLE WHICH WE ARE WAGING WITH WEAPONS IN HAND IS AIMED AT AN ARMY THAT\nHAS ONCE MORE DENIED TO OUR NATION THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING A FORMULA FOR\nA NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AT AN IMPORTANT CROSSROADS IN THE NATION'S HISTORY.\n\n   WE MADE A PROPOSAL TO HOLD FREE ELECTIONS, IN PEACE AND FOR PEACE, BUT\nTHE ARMY STUBBORNLY INSISTS ON HOLDING FRAUDULENT ELECTIONS, AT WAR AND FOR\nWAR.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD DURING WAR.\n  ",

      "text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 18 MAR 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [TEXT] ON THE EVE OF\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION\nIN SAN SALVADOR IS PARALYZED WHILE A MAJORITY OF THE RESIDENTS ARE NOT\nRECEIVING POTABLE WATER OR ELECTRIC POWER.\n\n   REPORTS ARRIVING THIS MORNING FROM THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAPITAL, STATE\nTHAT CITIES SUCH AS MEJICANOS, SAN MARCOS, APOPA, ISUSTEPEQUE, AND\nDELGADO, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE NOT RECEIVED BASIC PUBLIC SERVICES FOR THE PAST\n3 DAYS.\n\n   THE NATIONAL POLICE THIS MORNING REPORTED THAT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN\nSAN SALVADOR HAS BEEN MORE THAN 80 PERCENT HALTED FOR THE 3D DAY IN A ROW\nAND ONLY CERTAIN MINIBUSES AND LIGHT CARGO VEHICLES ARE SERVING CERTAIN\nROUTES.\n\n   WORKERS AT THE EASTERN AND WESTERN BUS TERMINALS OF THIS CAPITAL REPORT\nTHAT THE TRANSPORTATION SITUATION IS SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY'S.  NO BUSES HAVE\nARRIVED OR DEPARTED SAN SALVADOR FOR THE COUNTRY'S 13 DEPARTMENTS.\n\n   MUCH CENTRAL AMERICAN COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTATION IS ALSO PARALYZED BY THE\nTRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE IN EL SALVADOR SINCE MANY RAILROAD BOXCARS ARE BEING\nHELD UP AT THE SALVADORAN BORDERS UNABLE TO ENTER THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.\n\n   MEANWHILE, AT LEAST TWO BOMBS PLACED NEAR ELECTRIC POWER POLES WERE\nDETONATED THIS MORNING IN SAN SALVADOR.  ONE WAS PLACED AT 16 WEST STREET IN\nTHE IVU NEIGHBORHOOD, IN THE SOUTHERN AREA OF THE CAPITAL, AND A\nFRAGMENTATION GRENADE EXPLODED NEAR THE SANTA ISABEL NEIGHBORHOOD.  A\nTELEPHONE JUNCTION BOX, THE EXACT LOCATION OF WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN\nDETERMINED, WAS ALSO DESTROYED.\n\n   MILITARY SECURITY HAS BEEN STEPPED UP THROUGHOUT THIS CAPITAL AND ITS\nOUTSKIRTS ONLY 24 HOURS BEFORE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  OFFICIAL SOURCES\nTHIS MORNING REPORTED THAT ARMED FORCES TROOPS ARE MAINLY PATROLING SAN\nSALVADOR GAS STATIONS, SINCE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT\n[FMLN] URBAN COMMANDS HAVE THREATENED TO DESTROY THEM.\n\n   IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS ARE OVERFLYING\nTHE CAPITAL TO PROTECT VEHICLES THAT ARE TRANSITTING THE MAIN STREETS OF SAN\nSALVADOR, DESPITE THE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE DECREED BY THE INSURGENCY 3\nDAYS AGO.  REPORTS ALSO STATE THAT THE NATIONAL AND TREASURY POLICE ARE\nOFFERING FREE TRANSPORTATION TO PEOPLE HEADING FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE WORK\nPLACES.\n\n   THE ARMY IS USING LOUDSPEAKERS ON MILITARY VEHICLES TO URGE THE PEOPLE TO\nVOTE IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS TOMORROW.  FOR SUNDAY'S ELECTIONS, THE ARMY\nWILL DEPLOY A LARGE NUMBER OF UNITS TO TRANSPORT VOTERS, WHO WILL BE GOING\nTO THEIR RESPECTIVE POLLING PLACES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.\n\n   IN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL, POLICE-MILITARY SECURITY HAS BEEN STEPPED UP\nLESS THAN 24 BEFORE THE 1989 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  WE HAVE NOTICED A\nLARGER NUMBER OF SECURITY PERSONNEL NEAR THE SEVEN VOTING CENTERS THE\nCENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL HAS SET UP IN SAN SALVADOR MUNICIPALITY.  \n\n   IN THE OUTLYING CITIES OF NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, SUCH AS MEXICANOS,\nCUSCATANCINGO, AND APOPA, TRANSPORTATION IS STILL COMPLETELY PARALYZED IN\nTHE WAKE OF THE GROUND TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE DECREED BY THE FMLN, WHICH IS\nIN ITS 3D DAY TODAY.\n\n   MEANWHILE, REPORTS FROM CHALATENANGO, 72 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, STATE\nTHAT THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT IS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY DUE TO RATIONING THAT THE\nCEL [LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION] HAS IMPOSED ON\nTHE ENTIRE COUNTRY AFTER FMLN GUERRILLAS CARRIED OUT LARGE-SCALE SABOTAGE\nOPERATIONS AGAINST THE ELECTRICITY NETWORK EARLY THIS WEEK.\n\n   MILITARY SOURCES CONSULTED THIS MORNING IN CHALATENANGO SAID THAT THERE\nHAVE BEEN NO CLASHES BETWEEN MILITARY FORCES AND GUERRILLAS IN THAT AREA FOR\nTHE PAST FEW HOURS.  THESE SOURCES SAID THAT THE VOTING BOOTHS THAT WILL BE\nINSTALLED IN 33 MUNICIPALITIES OF THAT NORTHERN DEPARTMENT ARE READY.  THEY\nADDED THAT THE NUMBER OF MILITARY UNITS IN THAT AREA OF THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN\nINCREASED.",

NO BUSES HAVE\nARRIVED OR DEPARTED SAN SALVADOR FOR THE COUNTRY'S 13 DEPARTMENTS.\n\n   MUCH CENTRAL AMERICAN COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTATION IS ALSO PARALYZED BY THE\nTRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE IN EL SALVADOR SINCE MANY RAILROAD BOXCARS ARE BEING\nHELD UP AT THE SALVADORAN BORDERS UNABLE TO ENTER THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.\n\n   MEANWHILE, AT LEAST TWO BOMBS PLACED NEAR ELECTRIC POWER POLES WERE\nDETONATED THIS MORNING IN SAN SALVADOR.  ONE WAS PLACED AT 16 WEST STREET IN\nTHE IVU NEIGHBORHOOD, IN THE SOUTHERN AREA OF THE CAPITAL, AND A\nFRAGMENTATION GRENADE EXPLODED NEAR THE SANTA ISABEL NEIGHBORHOOD.  A\nTELEPHONE JUNCTION BOX, THE EXACT LOCATION OF WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN\nDETERMINED, WAS ALSO DESTROYED.\n\n   MILITARY SECURITY HAS BEEN STEPPED UP THROUGHOUT THIS CAPITAL AND ITS\nOUTSKIRTS ONLY 24 HOURS BEFORE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  OFFICIAL SOURCES\nTHIS MORNING REPORTED THAT ARMED FORCES TROOPS ARE MAINLY PATROLING SAN\nSALVADOR GAS STATIONS, SINCE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT\n[FMLN] URBAN COMMANDS HAVE THREATENED TO DESTROY THEM.\n\n   IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT SALVADORAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS ARE OVERFLYING\nTHE CAPITAL TO PROTECT VEHICLES THAT ARE TRANSITTING THE MAIN STREETS OF SAN\nSALVADOR, DESPITE THE TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE DECREED BY THE INSURGENCY 3\nDAYS AGO.  REPORTS ALSO STATE THAT THE NATIONAL AND TREASURY POLICE ARE\nOFFERING FREE TRANSPORTATION TO PEOPLE HEADING FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE WORK\nPLACES.\n\n   THE ARMY IS USING LOUDSPEAKERS ON MILITARY VEHICLES TO URGE THE PEOPLE TO\nVOTE IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS TOMORROW.  FOR SUNDAY'S ELECTIONS, THE ARMY\nWILL DEPLOY A LARGE NUMBER OF UNITS TO TRANSPORT VOTERS, WHO WILL BE GOING\nTO THEIR RESPECTIVE POLLING PLACES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.\n\n   IN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL, POLICE-MILITARY SECURITY HAS BEEN STEPPED UP\nLESS THAN 24 BEFORE THE 1989 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  WE HAVE NOTICED A\nLARGER NUMBER OF SECURITY PERSONNEL NEAR THE SEVEN VOTING CENTERS THE\nCENTRAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL HAS SET UP IN SAN SALVADOR MUNICIPALITY.  \n\n   IN THE OUTLYING CITIES OF NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, SUCH AS MEXICANOS,\nCUSCATANCINGO, AND APOPA, TRANSPORTATION IS STILL COMPLETELY PARALYZED IN\nTHE WAKE OF THE GROUND TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE DECREED BY THE FMLN, WHICH IS\nIN ITS 3D DAY TODAY.\n\n   MEANWHILE, REPORTS FROM CHALATENANGO, 72 KM NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, STATE\nTHAT THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT IS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY DUE TO RATIONING THAT THE\nCEL [LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION] HAS IMPOSED ON\nTHE ENTIRE COUNTRY AFTER FMLN GUERRILLAS CARRIED OUT LARGE-SCALE SABOTAGE\nOPERATIONS AGAINST THE ELECTRICITY NETWORK EARLY THIS WEEK.\n\n   MILITARY SOURCES CONSULTED THIS MORNING IN CHALATENANGO SAID THAT THERE\nHAVE BEEN NO CLASHES BETWEEN MILITARY FORCES AND GUERRILLAS IN THAT AREA FOR\nTHE PAST FEW HOURS.  THESE SOURCES SAID THAT THE VOTING BOOTHS THAT WILL BE\nINSTALLED IN 33 MUNICIPALITIES OF THAT NORTHERN DEPARTMENT ARE READY.  THEY\nADDED THAT THE NUMBER OF MILITARY UNITS IN THAT AREA OF THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN\nINCREASED.",

THOSE ARE THE EFFORTS [WORDS INDISTINCT].\n\n   [REPORTER] WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT DO ABOUT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI\nNATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]?\n\n   [PONCE] WE CAN ASK THEM TO JOIN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC, CIVIC LIFE TO\n[WORDS INDISTINCT] PEOPLE TO LIVE IN PEACE.\n\n   [REPORTER] HOW DO YOU VIEW THE VOTING SITUATION AND THE SECURITY AND\nSURVEILLANCE THE ARMED FORCES IS PROVIDING, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE ARMED\nFORCES ARE BEING CHARGED WITH THE DEATH OF TWO JOURNALISTS?  I THINK YOU ARE\nAWARE OF THAT.  TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.\n\n   [PONCE] WE ARE THE FIRST ONES TO REGRET THE DEATH OF THE CANAL DOCE\nNEWSMEN WHO DIED IN SAN MIGUEL AND THE REUTER CORRESPONDENT WHO DIED HERE ON\nARMY BOULEVARD.  THOSE DEATHS ARE THE RESULT OF THE PREVAILING UNREST AND\nNERVOUSNESS.  THERE ARE BULLETS BEING FIRED ALL OVER THE PLACE AND,\nUNFORTUNATELY, THOSE REPORTERS WERE THE FIRST TO GET HIT.  THIS CONTINUES TO\nBE A PROBLEM THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAS [WORDS INDISTINCT].\n\n   [REPORTER] DID THE ARMY SUFFER CASUALTIES DURING THE INCIDENTS IN SAN\nRAMON?\n\n   [PONCE] I CAN TELL YOU THAT A BRACAMONTE BATTALION CORPORAL DIED AND\nANOTHER SOLDIER WAS WOUNDED.  HOWEVER, THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE AND\nBRACAMONTE BATTALION SOLDIERS REACTED QUICKLY AND REPELLED THE TERRORIST\nACTIVITY THAT IS CURRENTLY CAUSING CHAOS IN SAN SALVADOR.  \n\n   [REPORTER] HAVE OTHER INCIDENTS BEEN REPORTED?\n\n   [PONCE] IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE WHAT THE FMLN IS SAYING. THEIR\nSPOKESMAN IN MEXICO CITY SAID THEY WOULD NOT ATTACK THE VOTING TABLES.\nHOWEVER, WE HAVE HEARD THAT VOTING TABLES HAVE BEEN ATTACKED IN 15 AREAS OF\nTHE COUNTRY.  ATTACKS ON VOTING TABLES WERE REPORTED IN CHALATENANGO, SAN\nANTONIO, CIUDAD BARRIOS, CAROLINA, AND NORTH [WORD INDISTINCT].  IN\nUSULUTAN, THE FMLN PLANTED TWO BOMBS JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY TO FRIGHTEN THE\nPEOPLE.  HOWEVER, OUR PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC NATURE IS TELLING THE FMLN:  WE DO\nNOT WANT TERRORISM, WE WANT PEACE, AND WE ARE USING PEACEFUL MEANS TO\nACHIEVE POWER AND CHOOSE OUR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT.\n\n   [REPORTER] HOW IS THE VOTING PROCESS PROGRESSING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY?\n\n   [PONCE] THERE ARE 27 MUNICIPALITIES WHERE ELECTIONS ARE NOT BEING HELD.\nWE KNOW FOR SURE THAT THERE ARE MUNICIPALITIES, LIKE CINQUERA AND ARAMBALA,\nWHERE [WORDS INDISTINCT], AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE KNOW\nTHERE ARE 27 MUNICIPALITIES WHERE THERE WILL BE NO VOTING AND THERE ARE\nOTHERS THAT [WORDS INDISTINCT] THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE POLITICAL\nPARTIES AND MEMBERS OF THE MUNICIPAL VOTING TABLE BOARDS [WORDS INDISTINCT].\n\n   [REPORTER] HOW MANY SOLDIERS ARE PROTECTING THE VOTING TABLE BOARDS\nTHROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY?\n\n   [PONCE] ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF OUR SOLDIERS ARE PART OF THE DEMOCRACY PLAN.\nWE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE OFFERING THE SAME PROTECTION AFTER THE VOTING\nCENTERS ARE CLOSED [WORDS INDISTINCT].\n\n   [REPORTER] WE HAVE READ SOME REPORTS THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE URGING THE\nPEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC].  WILL THE SOLDIERS\nBE ALLOWED TO VOTE?\n\n   [PONCE] FIRST, I EMPHATICALLY AND CATEGORICALLY DENY THAT WE ARE URGING\nTHE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THE PDC.  WE HAVE SENT A MEMORANDUM TO ALL THE\nCOMMANDERS AND [WORD INDISTINCT] CHIEFS ADVISING THEM THAT WE MUST HAVE A\nCOMPLETELY APOLITICAL ATTITUDE AND REFRAIN FROM PARTICIPATING IN ANY\nPOLITICAL ACTIVITY.  WE MUST PROTECT ALL POLITICAL PARTIES, WE MUST PROTECT\nALL THE VOTING CENTERS, AND WE MUST ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE AREAS\nSURROUNDING THE VOTING CENTERS.  WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN WHO WINS THE\nELECTIONS; WE ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS\nRESPECTED AND [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THIS IS A DAY FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE\nTO PROVE THEIR DEMOCRATIC NATURE.\n\n   [REPORTER] WILL SOLDIERS BE ALLOWED TO CAST THEIR VOTES TODAY?\n\n   [PONCE] AS SOLDIERS WE ALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE.  BUT BEFORE WE CAST\nOUR VOTE WE ARE GOING TO FULFILL OUR DUTY.  OUR DUTY IS TO GUARANTEE\nSAFETY.  THIS WILL NOT CREATE A PROBLEM.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF A SOLDIER'S\nIDENTIFICATION CARD WAS ISSUED IN SAN SALVADOR BUT HE IS STATIONED IN\nAGUILARES, HE WILL BE ALLOWED TO VOTE AT A SPECIFIC VOTING CENTER.  THOSE\nWHO CAN VOTE WILL DO SO AS CIVILIANS AND THEY WILL BE UNARMED.  [WORDS\nINDISTINCT] MOSTLY ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL AND [WORD INDISTINCT].\n\n   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE REBELS HAVE THREATENED TO LAUNCH A\nLARGE ATTACK.  DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH MEN TO FIGHT THEM AT THIS TIME?\n\n   [PONCE] SINCE 1982, WE HAVE [WORDS INDISTINCT] DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE\nCOUNTRY.  THE PEOPLE [WORDS INDISTINCT] BEFORE AND AFTER THE ELECTIONS.\n[WORDS INDISTINCT] AMID SABOTAGE TO THE POWER SYSTEM.  WE ARE ALSO\nEXPERIENCING A WATER PROBLEM [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE ARE GOING TO EXERCISE\nOUR RIGHT AS ESTABLISHED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND WE ARE GOING PROTECT THE\nINTEGRITY OF THE PEOPLE, OUR SOVEREIGNTY, AND [WORDS INDISTINCT]. [END\nRECORDING]",

THOSE ARE THE EFFORTS [WORDS INDISTINCT].\n\n   [REPORTER] WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT DO ABOUT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI\nNATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]?\n\n   [PONCE] WE CAN ASK THEM TO JOIN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC, CIVIC LIFE TO\n[WORDS INDISTINCT] PEOPLE TO LIVE IN PEACE.\n\n   [REPORTER] HOW DO YOU VIEW THE VOTING SITUATION AND THE SECURITY AND\nSURVEILLANCE THE ARMED FORCES IS PROVIDING, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE ARMED\nFORCES ARE BEING CHARGED WITH THE DEATH OF TWO JOURNALISTS?  I THINK YOU ARE\nAWARE OF THAT.  TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.\n\n   [PONCE] WE ARE THE FIRST ONES TO REGRET THE DEATH OF THE CANAL DOCE\nNEWSMEN WHO DIED IN SAN MIGUEL AND THE REUTER CORRESPONDENT WHO DIED HERE ON\nARMY BOULEVARD.  THOSE DEATHS ARE THE RESULT OF THE PREVAILING UNREST AND\nNERVOUSNESS.  THERE ARE BULLETS BEING FIRED ALL OVER THE PLACE AND,\nUNFORTUNATELY, THOSE REPORTERS WERE THE FIRST TO GET HIT.  THIS CONTINUES TO\nBE A PROBLEM THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAS [WORDS INDISTINCT].\n\n   [REPORTER] DID THE ARMY SUFFER CASUALTIES DURING THE INCIDENTS IN SAN\nRAMON?\n\n   [PONCE] I CAN TELL YOU THAT A BRACAMONTE BATTALION CORPORAL DIED AND\nANOTHER SOLDIER WAS WOUNDED.  HOWEVER, THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE AND\nBRACAMONTE BATTALION SOLDIERS REACTED QUICKLY AND REPELLED THE TERRORIST\nACTIVITY THAT IS CURRENTLY CAUSING CHAOS IN SAN SALVADOR.  \n\n   [REPORTER] HAVE OTHER INCIDENTS BEEN REPORTED?\n\n   [PONCE] IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE WHAT THE FMLN IS SAYING. THEIR\nSPOKESMAN IN MEXICO CITY SAID THEY WOULD NOT ATTACK THE VOTING TABLES.\nHOWEVER, WE HAVE HEARD THAT VOTING TABLES HAVE BEEN ATTACKED IN 15 AREAS OF\nTHE COUNTRY.  ATTACKS ON VOTING TABLES WERE REPORTED IN CHALATENANGO, SAN\nANTONIO, CIUDAD BARRIOS, CAROLINA, AND NORTH [WORD INDISTINCT].  IN\nUSULUTAN, THE FMLN PLANTED TWO BOMBS JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY TO FRIGHTEN THE\nPEOPLE.  HOWEVER, OUR PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC NATURE IS TELLING THE FMLN:  WE DO\nNOT WANT TERRORISM, WE WANT PEACE, AND WE ARE USING PEACEFUL MEANS TO\nACHIEVE POWER AND CHOOSE OUR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT.\n\n   [REPORTER] HOW IS THE VOTING PROCESS PROGRESSING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY?\n\n   [PONCE] THERE ARE 27 MUNICIPALITIES WHERE ELECTIONS ARE NOT BEING HELD.\nWE KNOW FOR SURE THAT THERE ARE MUNICIPALITIES, LIKE CINQUERA AND ARAMBALA,\nWHERE [WORDS INDISTINCT], AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE KNOW\nTHERE ARE 27 MUNICIPALITIES WHERE THERE WILL BE NO VOTING AND THERE ARE\nOTHERS THAT [WORDS INDISTINCT] THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE POLITICAL\nPARTIES AND MEMBERS OF THE MUNICIPAL VOTING TABLE BOARDS [WORDS INDISTINCT].\n\n   [REPORTER] HOW MANY SOLDIERS ARE PROTECTING THE VOTING TABLE BOARDS\nTHROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY?\n\n   [PONCE] ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF OUR SOLDIERS ARE PART OF THE DEMOCRACY PLAN.\nWE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE OFFERING THE SAME PROTECTION AFTER THE VOTING\nCENTERS ARE CLOSED [WORDS INDISTINCT].\n\n   [REPORTER] WE HAVE READ SOME REPORTS THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE URGING THE\nPEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC].  WILL THE SOLDIERS\nBE ALLOWED TO VOTE?\n\n   [PONCE] FIRST, I EMPHATICALLY AND CATEGORICALLY DENY THAT WE ARE URGING\nTHE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THE PDC.  WE HAVE SENT A MEMORANDUM TO ALL THE\nCOMMANDERS AND [WORD INDISTINCT] CHIEFS ADVISING THEM THAT WE MUST HAVE A\nCOMPLETELY APOLITICAL ATTITUDE AND REFRAIN FROM PARTICIPATING IN ANY\nPOLITICAL ACTIVITY.  WE MUST PROTECT ALL POLITICAL PARTIES, WE MUST PROTECT\nALL THE VOTING CENTERS, AND WE MUST ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE AREAS\nSURROUNDING THE VOTING CENTERS.  WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN WHO WINS THE\nELECTIONS; WE ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS\nRESPECTED AND [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THIS IS A DAY FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE\nTO PROVE THEIR DEMOCRATIC NATURE.\n\n   [REPORTER] WILL SOLDIERS BE ALLOWED TO CAST THEIR VOTES TODAY?\n\n   [PONCE] AS SOLDIERS WE ALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE.  BUT BEFORE WE CAST\nOUR VOTE WE ARE GOING TO FULFILL OUR DUTY.  OUR DUTY IS TO GUARANTEE\nSAFETY.  THIS WILL NOT CREATE A PROBLEM.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF A SOLDIER'S\nIDENTIFICATION CARD WAS ISSUED IN SAN SALVADOR BUT HE IS STATIONED IN\nAGUILARES, HE WILL BE ALLOWED TO VOTE AT A SPECIFIC VOTING CENTER.  THOSE\nWHO CAN VOTE WILL DO SO AS CIVILIANS AND THEY WILL BE UNARMED.  [WORDS\nINDISTINCT] MOSTLY ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL AND [WORD INDISTINCT].\n\n   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE REBELS HAVE THREATENED TO LAUNCH A\nLARGE ATTACK.  DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH MEN TO FIGHT THEM AT THIS TIME?\n\n   [PONCE] SINCE 1982, WE HAVE [WORDS INDISTINCT] DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE\nCOUNTRY.  THE PEOPLE [WORDS INDISTINCT] BEFORE AND AFTER THE ELECTIONS.\n[WORDS INDISTINCT] AMID SABOTAGE TO THE POWER SYSTEM.  WE ARE ALSO\nEXPERIENCING A WATER PROBLEM [WORDS INDISTINCT].  WE ARE GOING TO EXERCISE\nOUR RIGHT AS ESTABLISHED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND WE ARE GOING PROTECT THE\nINTEGRITY OF THE PEOPLE, OUR SOVEREIGNTY, AND [WORDS INDISTINCT]. [END\nRECORDING]",

ONCE THEY ARRIVED, THE\nPRISONERS ASKED PRISON AUTHORITIES TO TRANSFER THEM ELSEWHERE.\n\n   AFTER THE PRISONERS WERE PROPERLY IDENTIFIED AT THE PRISON WARDEN'S\nOFFICE, THEY WERE TAKEN TO A ZONE 18 PENITENTIARY IN GUATEMALA CITY.  \n\n   WE REPEAT:  ONE HUNDRED PRISONERS ESCAPED AND SOUGHT PROTECTION FROM THE\nAUTHORITIES, WHO IMMEDIATELY SENT THEM TO A PENITENTIARY IN ZONE 18 FOR\nTHEIR PROTECTION.\n\n   ACCORDING TO THE PRISONERS, THE RIOTERS CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THEIR\nPOSITION THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST FULFILL ALL THEIR DEMANDS.  THE RIOTING\nPRISONERS SHOT AT THE ESCAPEES, THUS FRIGHTENING THE CHILDREN AND THE\nELDERLY WHO REMAIN INSIDE THE PRISON.",

HIS BODY WAS BLOWN TO BITS BY THE EXPLOSION.  \n\n   THE WOUNDED MAN HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED.  HE WAS ADMITTED IN A\nSEMICONSCIOUS STATE TO THE BURNS UNIT OF THE ESCUELA HOSPITAL.\n\n   ACCORDING TO POLICE, THE BOMB WAS CHINESE-MADE AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN\nDETONATED BY HEAT FROM THE MOTORCYCLE OR FROM FRICTION CREATED AS A RESULT\nOF BEING PLACE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN ON THE MOTORCYCLE.\n\n   ANOTHER THEORY IS THAT THE TWO MEN DROPPED THE BOMB WHEN THEY TRIED TO\nTHROW IT AT THE WAREHOUSE, WHICH IS LOCATED 1 KM NORTHWEST OF THE U.S.\nEMBASSY.  POLICE BELIEVE THAT THE BOMB WAS GOING TO BE PLACED IN THE U.S.\nEMBASSY WAREHOUSE BY MEMBERS OF THE HONDURAN LEFT TO COMMEMMORATE WHAT\nPEOPLE HERE CALL \"BLACK APRIL\" FOR THE UNITED STATES.\n\n   ON 7 APRIL 1988, A MOB SET FIRE TO THE U.S. CONSULATE IN TEGUCIGALPA AND\nTO 30 DIPLOMATIC VEHICLES.",

MOST\nRADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS HAVE TRANSMISSION TOWERS ON THAT\nMOUNTAIN BECAUSE IT TOWERS OVER A VAST AREA OF GUATEMALA.\n\n   IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT A MAN, WHO IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN THE\nWATCHMAN AT CHANNEL 7'S TOWER, WAS KILLED BY THE BOMB.  THE SPOKESMEN [FOR\nCHANNEL 7] SAID THAT RESCUE UNITS SENT TO THE SITE HAVE YET TO RETURN TO\nTHE CAPITAL.\n\n   THE EXPLOSION WAS FELT IN SEVERAL NEARBY COMMUNITIES AND IN A SECTOR OF\nGUATEMALA CITY.  CHANNEL 7 SUDDENLY WENT OFF THE AIR JUST AS GUATEMALAN\nPRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO WAS ABOUT TO DELIVER A SPEECH.\nNEVERTHELESS, THE SPEECH WAS BROADCAST BY THE OTHER FOUR TELEVISION CHANNELS\nTHAT OPERATE IN GUATEMALA.  \n\n   THIS TERRORIST ACTION COMES IN THE WAKE OF A SERIES OF INCIDENTS THAT\nHAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST FEW DAYS AS A RESULT OF STRIKES BY TEACHERS, POST\nOFFICE WORKERS, FINANCE MINISTRY EMPLOYEES, AND OTHER SECTORS DEMANDING WAGE\nINCREASES.\n\n   A BOMB WAS FOUND BEFORE IT EXPLODED IN A BANK IN THE AFTERNOON OF 19\nJULY, AND SEVERAL ANONYMOUS CALLERS WARNED ABOUT OTHER TERRORIST BOMBS LAST\nNIGHT; HOWEVER, THESE TURNED OUT TO BE FALSE ALARMS.",

MOST\nRADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS HAVE TRANSMISSION TOWERS ON THAT\nMOUNTAIN BECAUSE IT TOWERS OVER A VAST AREA OF GUATEMALA.\n\n   IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT A MAN, WHO IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN THE\nWATCHMAN AT CHANNEL 7'S TOWER, WAS KILLED BY THE BOMB.  THE SPOKESMEN [FOR\nCHANNEL 7] SAID THAT RESCUE UNITS SENT TO THE SITE HAVE YET TO RETURN TO\nTHE CAPITAL.\n\n   THE EXPLOSION WAS FELT IN SEVERAL NEARBY COMMUNITIES AND IN A SECTOR OF\nGUATEMALA CITY.  CHANNEL 7 SUDDENLY WENT OFF THE AIR JUST AS GUATEMALAN\nPRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO AREVALO WAS ABOUT TO DELIVER A SPEECH.\nNEVERTHELESS, THE SPEECH WAS BROADCAST BY THE OTHER FOUR TELEVISION CHANNELS\nTHAT OPERATE IN GUATEMALA.  \n\n   THIS TERRORIST ACTION COMES IN THE WAKE OF A SERIES OF INCIDENTS THAT\nHAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST FEW DAYS AS A RESULT OF STRIKES BY TEACHERS, POST\nOFFICE WORKERS, FINANCE MINISTRY EMPLOYEES, AND OTHER SECTORS DEMANDING WAGE\nINCREASES.\n\n   A BOMB WAS FOUND BEFORE IT EXPLODED IN A BANK IN THE AFTERNOON OF 19\nJULY, AND SEVERAL ANONYMOUS CALLERS WARNED ABOUT OTHER TERRORIST BOMBS LAST\nNIGHT; HOWEVER, THESE TURNED OUT TO BE FALSE ALARMS.",

AT THE SAME TIME, A BOMB EXPLODED AT A\nUNIVERSITY BRANCH IN LA CEIBA.  \n\n   ALL THE BLASTS OCCURRED AT 1130 (LOCAL TIME).  ONLY ONE PERSON WHO\nHAPPENED TO BE PASSING BY THE CENTRAL PARK IN TEGUCIGALPA AT THE TIME OF THE\nEXPLOSION WAS WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE BLASTS.  A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE\nNEW GROUP POINTS OUT THAT \"ONE DOES NOT WEEP FOR MARTYRS, BUT AVENGES THEM\"\nAND ADDS THAT \"TRAITOR INDIANS COME BEFORE THE INVADING GRINGOS.\"\n\n   THE PROCLAMATION CRITICIZES THE MURDER OF POPULAR LEADERS THAT TOOK PLACE\nIN THE COUNTRY IN EARLY JULY AND DENOUNCES OTHER LEFTIST LABOR AND GUERRILLA\nORGANIZATIONS.\n\n   THE ARMED FORCES, THROUGH ITS COMMANDER, GENERAL HUMBERTO REGALADO\nHERNANDEZ, RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY BY STATING THAT \"THE ONLY REAL COMMUNISTS\nLEFT IN THE WORLD ARE HONDURANS, BECAUSE THEY ARE CHANGING IN OTHER\nCOUNTRIES\" AND ARE NO LONGER EXPLODING BOMBS.  \n\n   THE MILITARY LEADER ASKED PEOPLE TO ATTACH NO SIGNIFICANCE TO THE\nINCIDENT AND SAID THAT SHOULD THE WAVE OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE CONTINUE,\nLEFTIST GROUPS WOULD HAVE TO BE CALLED TO A DIALOGUE TO AVOID OTHER SIMILAR\nACTIONS.\n\n   THE \"9 MAY\" FPL PROCLAMATION WAS ISSUED IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF SAN PEDRO\nSULA, 255 KM FROM TEGUCIGALPA.",

AT THE SAME TIME, A BOMB EXPLODED AT A\nUNIVERSITY BRANCH IN LA CEIBA.  \n\n   ALL THE BLASTS OCCURRED AT 1130 (LOCAL TIME).  ONLY ONE PERSON WHO\nHAPPENED TO BE PASSING BY THE CENTRAL PARK IN TEGUCIGALPA AT THE TIME OF THE\nEXPLOSION WAS WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE BLASTS.  A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE\nNEW GROUP POINTS OUT THAT \"ONE DOES NOT WEEP FOR MARTYRS, BUT AVENGES THEM\"\nAND ADDS THAT \"TRAITOR INDIANS COME BEFORE THE INVADING GRINGOS.\"\n\n   THE PROCLAMATION CRITICIZES THE MURDER OF POPULAR LEADERS THAT TOOK PLACE\nIN THE COUNTRY IN EARLY JULY AND DENOUNCES OTHER LEFTIST LABOR AND GUERRILLA\nORGANIZATIONS.\n\n   THE ARMED FORCES, THROUGH ITS COMMANDER, GENERAL HUMBERTO REGALADO\nHERNANDEZ, RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY BY STATING THAT \"THE ONLY REAL COMMUNISTS\nLEFT IN THE WORLD ARE HONDURANS, BECAUSE THEY ARE CHANGING IN OTHER\nCOUNTRIES\" AND ARE NO LONGER EXPLODING BOMBS.  \n\n   THE MILITARY LEADER ASKED PEOPLE TO ATTACH NO SIGNIFICANCE TO THE\nINCIDENT AND SAID THAT SHOULD THE WAVE OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE CONTINUE,\nLEFTIST GROUPS WOULD HAVE TO BE CALLED TO A DIALOGUE TO AVOID OTHER SIMILAR\nACTIONS.\n\n   THE \"9 MAY\" FPL PROCLAMATION WAS ISSUED IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF SAN PEDRO\nSULA, 255 KM FROM TEGUCIGALPA.",

AT THE SAME TIME, A BOMB EXPLODED AT A\nUNIVERSITY BRANCH IN LA CEIBA.  \n\n   ALL THE BLASTS OCCURRED AT 1130 (LOCAL TIME).  ONLY ONE PERSON WHO\nHAPPENED TO BE PASSING BY THE CENTRAL PARK IN TEGUCIGALPA AT THE TIME OF THE\nEXPLOSION WAS WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE BLASTS.  A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE\nNEW GROUP POINTS OUT THAT \"ONE DOES NOT WEEP FOR MARTYRS, BUT AVENGES THEM\"\nAND ADDS THAT \"TRAITOR INDIANS COME BEFORE THE INVADING GRINGOS.\"\n\n   THE PROCLAMATION CRITICIZES THE MURDER OF POPULAR LEADERS THAT TOOK PLACE\nIN THE COUNTRY IN EARLY JULY AND DENOUNCES OTHER LEFTIST LABOR AND GUERRILLA\nORGANIZATIONS.\n\n   THE ARMED FORCES, THROUGH ITS COMMANDER, GENERAL HUMBERTO REGALADO\nHERNANDEZ, RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY BY STATING THAT \"THE ONLY REAL COMMUNISTS\nLEFT IN THE WORLD ARE HONDURANS, BECAUSE THEY ARE CHANGING IN OTHER\nCOUNTRIES\" AND ARE NO LONGER EXPLODING BOMBS.  \n\n   THE MILITARY LEADER ASKED PEOPLE TO ATTACH NO SIGNIFICANCE TO THE\nINCIDENT AND SAID THAT SHOULD THE WAVE OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE CONTINUE,\nLEFTIST GROUPS WOULD HAVE TO BE CALLED TO A DIALOGUE TO AVOID OTHER SIMILAR\nACTIONS.\n\n   THE \"9 MAY\" FPL PROCLAMATION WAS ISSUED IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF SAN PEDRO\nSULA, 255 KM FROM TEGUCIGALPA.",

AT THE SAME TIME, A BOMB EXPLODED AT A\nUNIVERSITY BRANCH IN LA CEIBA.  \n\n   ALL THE BLASTS OCCURRED AT 1130 (LOCAL TIME).  ONLY ONE PERSON WHO\nHAPPENED TO BE PASSING BY THE CENTRAL PARK IN TEGUCIGALPA AT THE TIME OF THE\nEXPLOSION WAS WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE BLASTS.  A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE\nNEW GROUP POINTS OUT THAT \"ONE DOES NOT WEEP FOR MARTYRS, BUT AVENGES THEM\"\nAND ADDS THAT \"TRAITOR INDIANS COME BEFORE THE INVADING GRINGOS.\"\n\n   THE PROCLAMATION CRITICIZES THE MURDER OF POPULAR LEADERS THAT TOOK PLACE\nIN THE COUNTRY IN EARLY JULY AND DENOUNCES OTHER LEFTIST LABOR AND GUERRILLA\nORGANIZATIONS.\n\n   THE ARMED FORCES, THROUGH ITS COMMANDER, GENERAL HUMBERTO REGALADO\nHERNANDEZ, RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY BY STATING THAT \"THE ONLY REAL COMMUNISTS\nLEFT IN THE WORLD ARE HONDURANS, BECAUSE THEY ARE CHANGING IN OTHER\nCOUNTRIES\" AND ARE NO LONGER EXPLODING BOMBS.  \n\n   THE MILITARY LEADER ASKED PEOPLE TO ATTACH NO SIGNIFICANCE TO THE\nINCIDENT AND SAID THAT SHOULD THE WAVE OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE CONTINUE,\nLEFTIST GROUPS WOULD HAVE TO BE CALLED TO A DIALOGUE TO AVOID OTHER SIMILAR\nACTIONS.\n\n   THE \"9 MAY\" FPL PROCLAMATION WAS ISSUED IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF SAN PEDRO\nSULA, 255 KM FROM TEGUCIGALPA.",

FOR EXAMPLE, HE\nSAID ARMED GROUPS ARRIVE AT HOUSES AT NIGHT AND RAPE ENTIRE FAMILIES.\n\"THESE POLICIES OF TERROR HAVE BEEN USED IN BRAZIL, CHILE, VIETNAM, EL\nSALVADOR, AND GUATEMALA, AMONG OTHER COUNTRIES,\" HE SAID.  \n\n   THE FORMER UNIVERSITY RECTOR SAID THAT THIS POLICY OF TERROR, WHICH HAS\nRECENTLY BEEN INTENSIFIED, TRIES TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A\nSUBVERSIVE CELL THAT IS DESTABILIZING THE COUNTRY PRIOR TO THE HOLDING OF\nTHE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN TELA, ATLANTIDA DEPARTMENT.\n\n   THE PEOPLE'S LEADERS SAID THAT \"THE TERRORISM OF THE HONDURAN DEMOCRATIC\nSTATE IS ALSO SHOWN BY AN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT IS EXTENSIVELY CONTROLLED\nBY THE AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE EXECUTION OF POOR\nHONDURANS BY REPRESSIVE FORCES THAT HAVE BEEN TRAINED BY U.S. EXPERTS.\"\n\n   THEY SAID THE TERRORISM IS ALSO DEMOSTRATED IN THE NONFULFILLMENT OF THE\nESQUIPULAS II PEACE AGREEMENTS, BY A POLICY THAT CAPITULATES TO THE IMF AND\nTHE WORLD BANK, THE MAINTENANCE OF EXTREME SECURITY, AND THE FACILITIES\nGIVEN TO THE THE CONTRAS AND THE U.S. ARMY.\n\n   AFTER MAKING THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS, THE FUTH AND THE CCOP ASKED THE\nGOVERNMENT TO HALT STATE TERRORISM AND TO BRING TO JUSTICE THOSE RESPONSIBLE\nFOR THE POLITICAL CRIMES AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S LEADERS.  THEY ALSO DEMANDED\nTHAT THE PEACE AGREEMENTS BE RESPECTED, THAT THE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION\nCOMMISSION'S REPORT ON REPRESSION BE MADE KNOWN, AND THAT THE NICARAGUAN\nCONTRAS BE DEMOBILIZED.\n\n   THEY ALSO PROPOSED THAT THE STATE CARRY OUT A REAL POLICY OF\nDEMOCRATIZATION WITH THE PEOPLE'S PARTICIPATION IN THE FACE OF PRESSURE FROM\nTHE IMF, THE WORLD BANK, AND THE U.S. EMBASSY.\n\n   THEY ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT ADOPT A PATRIOTIC POSITION SO THAT\nTHE U.S. BASES AND THE CONTRAS WILL BE WITHDRAWN FROM HONDURAS BECAUSE THEY\nCONSTITUTE A THREAT TO PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.\n\n   THE CCOP AND THE FUTH ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAVE SCHEDULED \"A GREAT\nMARCH FOR NATIONAL DIGNITY\" THIS AFTERNOON TO MARK THE HEROIC DEEDS OF\nLEMPIRA, THE DEFENDER OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND DIGNITY.\n\n   THE MARCH WILL BEGIN AT 1600 AT THE COMAYAGUELA OBELISK AND END AT\nTEGUCIGALPA'S MAIN SQUARE.\n\n   THE DEMONSTRATION WILL ALSO DEMAND THE REJECTION OF THE IMF AND WORLD\nBANK'S PROPOSALS, THE EXPULSION OF THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS AND RESPECT FOR\nTHE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENTS.",

THIS IS THE\nREBELS' 33D ATTACK AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S OIL NETWORK IN 1989.  THE\nAUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO OIL SPILL BECAUSE AT THE TIME OF THE\nATTACK, NO OIL WAS BEING PUMPED THROUGH THE PIPELINE.\n\n   A WOMAN WHO SAID SHE WAS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE UC-ELN CALLED THE CALI\nMEDIA TO CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK.\n\n   THE UC-ELN IS ATTACKING COLOMBIA'S OIL PIPELINES AS A WAY TO PRESSURE THE\nGOVERNMENT TO NATIONALIZE THE OIL INDUSTRY AND TO SIGN MORE FAVORABLE\nCONTRACTS WITH MULTINATIONAL OIL COMPANIES. THIS YEAR ALONE, THE UC-ELN\nLAUNCHED 25 ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL PIPELINE, THE LONGEST IN\nCOLOMBIA. THE ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON- COVENAS PIPELINE HAVE CAUSED\nAPPROXIMATE $150 MILLION IN DAMAGE.\n\n   IF THE SIX ATTACKS ON THE PACIFIC OIL PIPELINE AND THE TWO ON THE\nDINA-SALGAR OIL PIPELINE ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION, LOSSES AMOUNT TO\nAPPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION. THE DINA-SALGAR PIPELINE CARRIES CRUDE OIL FROM\nTHE OIL FIELDS IN TOLIMA TO THE REFINERY IN BARRANCABERMEJA.",

I MAKE THIS REPORT 50 DAYS AFTER ASSUMING POWER.  AT THIS\nTIME I WANT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH; I WANT TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT OUR\nSITUATION IS SO THAT WE WILL ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT WE MUST DO IN THE\nFUTURE.  EVERY SALVADORAN MUST SHARE IN THE SACRIFICE AND EFFORT.\nTHOSE OF US WHO HAVE A BIT MUST SHOW SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE\nNOTHING OR VERY LITTLE.\n\n   THE SITUATION IS CRITICAL, BUT WE MUST CONFRONT IT.  THAT IS WHY WE HAVE\nA GOVERNMENT:  TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.  WE ARE WILLING TO DO THIS RESPONSIBLY,\nBECAUSE WE KNOW THAT DOING NOTHING WOULD MEAN A GREATER CRISIS FOR THE\nSALVADORAN PEOPLE AND WOULD SINK OUR HOMELAND EVEN DEEPER IN THE BLACK ABYSS.\n\n   WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY CONCERNS; WE HAVE HEARD DIFFERENT GROUPS\nASKING THAT THE GOVERNMENT STATE WHAT IT IS PLANNING TO DO TO SOLVE THE\nPROBLEMS.  I WOULD LIKE TO STATE, HOWEVER, THAT WE PREFER TO ACT CALMLY,\nSTUDY THE PROBLEM IN DEPTH, AND FIND A SOLUTION THAT WILL TRULY SOLVE THE\nPROBLEM.  WE WOULD RATHER DO THIS THAN MAKE A RASH DECISION AND MAKE A\nMISTAKE.  THIS IS A TRULY DIFFICULT TASK.\n\n   BECAUSE I WANT TO TELL YOU IN ALL HONESTY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE\nCOUNTRY, I WISH TO TOUCH ON THE THREE MAJOR AREAS THAT CREATE CONCERN AND\nTHAT I FEEL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.  \n\n   FIRST, LET US TALK ABOUT PEACE.  SINCE THIS GOVERNMENT WAS SWORN AND\nINDISCRIMINATE MURDERS.  THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS, BECAUSE ON 1 JUNE WE\nEXPRESSED OUR RESOLVE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK TO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO\nTHE CONFLICT.  THE FMLN'S RESPONSE, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN MORE VIOLENCE.\n\n   WE KNOW MANY GROUPS COMPLAIN ABOUT THE VIOLENCE AND INSECURITY; THEY HAVE\nEVERY REASON TO COMPLAIN.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE WILLING TO DO ALL THEY CAN\nTO PROTECT EVERYONE.  THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS IN THE PAST DAYS, ESPECIALLY\nIN THOSE AREAS WHERE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS HAVE BEEN STRONGER.  THE ARMED\nFORCES HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED MANY TIMES AND BY MANY GROUPS, ESPECIALLY THOSE\nGROUPS THAT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SHARE THE FMLN'S IDEAS.  THEY CLAIM THAT\nTHE ARMED FORCES ACT IN A REPRESSIVE MANNER.  DEAR SALVADORAN PEOPLE, LET US\nANALYZE WHAT REALLY IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY.\n\n   THE ARMED FORCES' DUTY IS TO CONTROL ALL THOSE SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE\nLAW IS BROKEN.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING PUBLIC\nORDER.  THE ARMED FORCES ONLY TAKE ACTION WHEN THERE ARE GROUPS THAT ONLY\nCREATE VIOLENCE AND DISRUPT PUBLIC ORDER.  THE ARMED FORCES DO NOT TAKE\nACTION JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TAKE ACTION.  WE HAVE AN ARMED FORCES TO\nDEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND NEVER TO ATTACK THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.\nTHEREFORE, WHAT WE MUST DO IS LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHO IS REFUSING TO MAKE A\nCOMMITMENT AND WHO IS REFUSING TO SIT DOWN, IN A RATIONAL AND PEACEFUL\nMANNER, TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS CONFLICT THAT NO LONGER HAS A PLACE IN\nOUR HISTORY.  THEREFORE, I WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT WHAT WE, AS A GOVERNMENT,\nSAID ON 1 JUNE.  ON THAT DAY WE EXPRESSED OUR WILLINGNESS TO SIT DOWN AND\nTALK.  I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THIS A BIT, BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN\nMISUNDERSTANDINGS OVER OUR INTENTIONS IN THIS DIALOGUE. [CONTINUED]",

      "text": "   SAN SALVADOR, NO DATE -- [SPEECH] [CRISTIANI] [TEXT] [CONTINUED]\nSECOND, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S HEALTH.  WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE VERY\nSHORT TERM, WE HAD TO SUPPLY ALL THE HEALTH FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS\nWITH AT LEAST THE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED MEDICINES FOR THE PEOPLE.  WE\nHAVE ALLOTTED 17 MILLION COLONS FOR THE HEALTH MINISTRY FOR THE\nPURCHASE OF THE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED MEDICINES AND FOR THE\nDISTRIBUTION OF THIS MEDICINE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SO THAT THE POOR\nWILL RECEIVE THE EFFICIENT HEALTH SERVICES THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST\nPROVIDE.\n\n   THE EDUCATION MINISTRY HAS BEEN ASKED TO GIVE STUDENTS THE MATERIALS THEY\nNEED TO PURSUE THEIR STUDIES.  A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY HAS BEEN ALLOTTED\nFOR THE PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT NEEDED BY THE SCHOOLS.  WHEN THE 1990 SCHOOL\nYEAR BEGINS, WE MUST BE PREPARED TO PROVIDE THE SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS WITH\nTHE MATERIAL THEY NEED.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO BEGIN, AS\nSOON AS POSSIBLE, REPAIRING THE STREETS AND ROADS.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE\nCAN SEE THAT THIS IS ALREADY BEING DONE.\n\n   FINALLY, LOW-INCOME HOUSING.  NEXT WEEK THE PUBLIC WORKS MINISTER WILL\nANNOUNCE THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING PLAN, AND HE WILL EXPLAIN HOW WE WILL HELP\nLOW-INCOME FAMILIES BUY HOMES.  THIS WILL BE DONE THROUGH A SUBSIDY PLAN\nENSURING THAT LOW-INCOME GROUPS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY STEEP PAYMENTS AND\nWILL HAVE MONEY LEFT OVER FOR FOOD AND OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES.\n\n   WE HAVE ALREADY DRAFTED A SOCIAL EMERGENCY PLAN.  THIS PLAN WILL BE\nIMPLEMENTED IN SEPTEMBER, AND ITS FIRST PHASE WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN THE\nHIGHLY POPULATED URBAN AREAS.  THE PLAN WILL BENEFIT APPROXIMATELY 200\nCOMMUNITIES AND, AS OF NOW, I ASK THE MAYORS FOR THEIR HELP, BECAUSE WE WANT\nTO WORK WITH THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS.  THIS FIRST PHASE WILL BE AIMED AT\nPROVIDING LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES WITH PUBLIC UTILITIES.  WE WILL PROVIDE\nTHEM WITH ELECTRICITY AND RUNNING WATER, WE WILL BUILD SEWER SYSTEMS, AND WE\nWILL HELP THEM IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND NUTRITION.  AMID THE CRISIS WE ARE\nEXPERIENCING, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE SMALL - SCALE\nBUSINESSMEN IN THESE COMMUNITIES.  WE WILL ORGANIZE A LOAN SYSTEM FOR SMALL\n- SIZE BUSINESSES FOR DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES.  I REPEAT:  THIS\nSOCIAL EMERGENCY PLAN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN SEPTEMBER.  IN THE NEXT FEW\nWEEKS, WE WILL BEGIN TO SEEK THE COOPERATION OF THOSE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS\nTHAT WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE PLAN.\n\n   THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE MUST ALL STRUGGLE FOR, AND THAT IS TO\nABOLISH UNEMPLOYMENT.  WE MUST STRUGGLE SO THAT EVERY SALVADORAN WILL HAVE\nTHE CHANCE TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING.  WE THEREFORE WISH TO LAUNCH AN\nOFFENSIVE AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT.  WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT\nVIOLENCE IS THROUGH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, SO THAT THE PEOPLE WILL NOT\nFIND THEMSELVES IN THE SITUATION WHERE THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY MUST COMMIT\nCRIMES TO SURVIVE OR THAT THEY MUST GET INVOLVED IN THE TYPE OF VIOLENCE\nSPONSORED BY THE FMLN TERRORISTS.  THEREFORE, IN SEPTEMBER, WE WILL ALSO\nIMPLEMENT AN EMERGENCY PLAN TO GENERATE EMPLOYMENT.  THIS PLAN HAS SOME\nSPECIFIC GOALS:  FIRST, TO PROVIDE A BASIC JOB FOR THOSE PERSONS WHO ARE\nUNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED.  OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE 20,000 JOBS PER MONTH\nFOR THESE PEOPLE.  THIS PLAN WILL BE DRAFTED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, AND WE\nWILL IMPLEMENT IT DURING THOSE MONTHS WHEN THERE IS USUALLY A DROP IN\nEMPLOYMENT.  I MUST STRESS THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN\nDURING THE SOWING AND HARVEST SEASONS, BECAUSE DURING THOSE SEASONS THERE IS\nAN OVERABUNDANCE OF JOBS. [CONTINUED]",

THE ARMED FORCES\nBELIEVE THAT SUCH ATTACKS ARE NOT THE WAY TO SOLVE THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND\nPOLITICAL PROBLEMS.\n\n   IN ADDITION, THESE VIOLENT ACTIONS ONLY CONFUSE THE PUBLIC, BECAUSE\nUNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE ALWAYS BLAME THE ARMY FOR ANY SUCH ACTION, WITHOUT FIRST\nCONDUCTING AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION OF THE ORIGIN OF THE ATTACKS.\n\n   THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALWAYS REITERATED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ENSURE\nRESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROPERTY, AND THE LIFE AND\nSAFETY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

QUITE TO THE CONTRARY, WE WANT TO FULLY SUPPORT IT IN ORDER TO\nGUARANTEE THAT PEASANTS IN AREAS AFFECTED BY THE AGRARIAN REFORM ARE FREE TO\nCHOOSE THE KIND OF PROPERTY OWNERSHIP THAT BEST SUITS THEIR NEEDS, IN\nACCORDANCE WITH THE GREAT FREEDOMS GUARANTEED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND LAWS\nOF THE REPUBLIC.\n\n   OUR GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO WORK HARD TO ENSURE THAT OUR BROTHER\nPEASANTS ARE INDEED BENEFITED BY THE AGRARIAN REFORM AND THAT THEY WILL NOT\nBE USED AS A DEMAGOGICAL BANNER AT THE SERVICE OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGY, AS WAS\nTHE CASE UNTIL RECENTLY.  WE WANT PEASANTS' WELFARE TO BE THE OBJECTIVE OF\nOUR AGRARIAN REFORM; WE WANT AGRARIAN REFORM TO DEVELOP WITHIN A LEGAL,\nHONEST, AND PATRIOTIC FRAMEWORK.\n\n   WE ARE AGAINST THE DEMAGOGUERY OF STATIC PATERNALISM, BECAUSE WE WANT\nPEASANTS TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN FATE, TO TRULY PARTICIPATE IN THEIR\nPRODUCTION UNITS' DECISIONMAKING PROCESS, IN THE MARKETING OF THEIR\nPRODUCTS, AND IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE.\n\n   IT IS NEITHER FAIR NOR CORRECT, AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN THE PAST, TO\nBENEFIT OFFICE WORKERS, WHO HAVE NEVER SWEATED IN THE FIELDS UNDER THE\nAGRARIAN REFORM, WHEN YOU -- THE PEASANTS -- ARE NOW FACING DEBTS AND ARE\nWORSE OFF THAN BEFORE YOU OWNED LAND.\n\n   OUR GOVERNMENT AND YOU WILL GRADUALLY CHANGE THIS SITUATION TO ENSURE\nTHAT YOU WILL ENTHUSIASTICALLY WORK YOUR LAND, KNOWING THAT THE FRUIT OF\nYOUR LABOR WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT YOUR FAMILIES.  WE ARE SURE THAT WITH\nEFFICIENT ORGANIZATION, PROMPT CREDIT, ADEQUATE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND\nTHE HARDWORKING LEGACY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE WILL TURN THE AGRARIAN\nREFORM INTO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WILL\nBENEFIT ALL SALVADORANS BY PROMOTING PRODUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY.\n\n   DEAR PEASANTS:\n\n   WE WISH TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TELL YOU THAT OUR\nGOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO WORK WITH YOU.  THROUGH THE RELEVANT\nORGANIZATIONS, THE GOVERNMENT WILL IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS TO COMPLETELY UPGRADE\nTHE SALVADORAN PEASANTS' CONDITIONS.  \n\n   THROUGH FINATA, WE WILL CONTINUE TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OF MORE LAND\nFOR DISTRIBUTION AMONG THOUSANDS OF PEASANT FAMILIES.\n\n   DEAR FRIENDS:\n\n   OUR GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO ACHIEVE PEACE, BECAUSE WE ARE AWARE THAT\nTHE FMLN'S TERRORIST VIOLENCE DISTURBS THE CALM AND NORMAL PROCEDURE OF\nRURAL ACTIVITIES; WE REALIZE THAT WE MUST END THE VIOLENCE SO THAT WE CAN\nALL GO BACK TO WORK AND BRING ABOUT A NATIONAL RECOVERY.  PEASANTS HAVE\nSUFFERED THE MOST THROUGHOUT THE CONFLICT UNLEASHED BY THE TERRORIST\nMARXIST-LENINIST GROUPS, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE TIME HAS COME TO SEEK THE\nPEACE THAT WE ALL WANT IN ORDER TO RESTORE SOCIAL HARMONY, MUTUAL RESPECT,\nAND FRATERNAL LOVE AMONG ALL SALVADORANS WITHOUT EXCEPTION.  \n\n   ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC, WE HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY\nPLEASED TO PRESENT THESE PERMANENT LAND TITLE DEEDS TO THE BENEFICIARIES OF\nDECREE 207.  WE CONGRATULATE AND INVITE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER TO\nHELP THE FATHERLAND RECOVER FROM THE CRISIS AND TO BUILD FOR OUR CHILDREN\nAND ALL SALVADORANS A FUTURE OF PEACE, JUSTICE, LIBERTY, AND PROGRESS.",

      "text": "   BUENOS AIRES, 28 JUL 89 (ARGENTINA TELEVISORA COLOR NETWORK) --\n[SPEECH] [ALVARO ALSOGARAY, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER ON FOREIGN DEBT\nMATTERS] [EXCERPTS] GOOD EVENING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.  TODAY WE WILL\nDISCUSS THE FOREIGN DEBT PROBLEM.  THIS SUBJECT COULD PERHAPS SEEM A\nBIT OUT PLACE AT A TIME WHEN MORE TROUBLESOME MATTERS AFFECT ALL\nARGENTINE FAMILIES, SUCH AS HIGH PUBLIC UTILITY RATES, PRICES,\nCONTROLS, DIFFICULTIES, ETC.  HOWEVER, WE MUST ATTEND TO THE FOREIGN\nDEBT PROBLEM BECAUSE MOST OUR DIFFICULTIES COME FROM IT.\n\n   OF WHAT DOES THIS PROBLEM CONSIST?  WE CURRENTLY OWE $64 BILLION.  THIS\nREPRESENTS A BURDEN OF $6 BILLION YEARLY IN INTEREST PAYMENTS.  SINCE\nARGENTINA IS CURRENTLY EXPORTING $9 BILLION ANNUALLY, AND IF WE PAID $6\nBILLION IN INTEREST, WE WOULD ONLY HAVE $3 BILLION LEFT ANNUALLY TO ATTEND\nTO ALL OUR NATIONAL NEEDS, THAT IS, THE NEEDS OF INDUSTRY, COMMERCE, ETC.\n\n   OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY, AND WE CANNOT PAY $6 BILLION IN\nINTEREST EACH YEAR WITH $9 BILLION WORTH OF ANNUAL EXPORTS.\n\n   THIS IS NOT NEW.  THIS IS A HEAVY INHERITANCE, WHICH ORIGINATED NOT IN\nTHE RECENT PAST BUT MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO.  WHEN MARTINEZ DE HOZ BECAME\nECONOMY MINISTER [MARCH 1976], THE FOREIGN DEBT AMOUNTED TO $9 BILLION.\nWHEN HE CONCLUDED HIS TERM, THE DEBT AMOUNTED TO $29 BILLION.  THE\nMILITARY GOVERNMENTS THAT CAME AFTER HIM DRAGGED THE DEBT ALONG AND\nINCREASED IT TO $44 BILLION WHICH THEY PASSED TO PRESIDENT ALFONSIN.\nALFONSIN'S ADMINISTRATION INCREASED THE DEBT BY AN ADDITIONAL $20 BILLION.\nSO TODAY OUR DEBT AMOUNTS TO $64 BILLION.\n\n   THIS IS NOT ALL.  WE CEASED HONORING OUR COMMITMENTS ABROAD.  WE HAVE NOT\nEVEN PAID INTEREST SINCE APRIL LAST YEAR.  WE HAVE ONLY MADE TOKEN\nPAYMENTS.  THIS REFUTES THE IDEAS OF THOSE WHO SAY: LET US STOP PAYING OUR\nDEBT AND USE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THE COUNTRY GROW.  WE ARE NOT PAYING\nANYTHING.\n\n   FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WE HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING ANYTHING, AND NOT ONLY HAS\nTHE ECONOMY NOT GROWN, BUT IT SHRANK.\n\n   ARGENTINA HAS AN EXTREMELY LOW CREDIT RATING.  COUNTRIES ARE\nINTERNATIONALLY CLASSIFIED BY THEIR CREDIT, AND WE ARE IN ONE OF THE LOWEST\nCATEGORIES.  OUR COMMERCIAL CREDIT IS ALSO BEING CURTAILED.  COMMERCIAL\nCREDITS ARE THE ONES THAT ALLOW US TO IMPORT, EXPORT, AND MEET OUR DAILY\nNEEDS.\n\n   WHEN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION ASSUMED POWER ON 8 APRIL 1989, THE CENTRAL\nBANK'S FOREIGN RESERVES WERE EXHAUSTED.  THIS SITUATION CAN TURN INTO A\nCRISIS AT ANY MOMENT.  WE CANNOT CONTINUE LIKE THIS.\n\n   THE COMING OF THIS NEW GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS BROUGHT ABOUT POSITIVE\nEXPECTATIONS AND HOPE, AND WHICH IS UNDERTAKING REMARKABLE CHANGES -- MAINLY\nCHANGES OF MENTALITY -- HAS STOPPED THE CRISIS FROM EXPLODING.  BUT WE\nCANNOT REST ON OUR ACHIEVEMENTS.  WE MUST FACE THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY.\n\n   OUR STARTING POINT IN CERTAINLY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.  OUR COUNTRY HAS NO\nPRESTIGE ABROAD; WE HAVE LOST OUR CREDIBILITY.  NO ONE EVEN WANTS TO HEAR\nABOUT ARGENTINA, OR AT LEAST ABOUT ITS DEBT.  IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE\nNOT HONORED ANY OF OUR COMMIETMENTS.  EVERY TIME WE SIGNED A LETTER OF\nINTENT WITH THE IMF, WE KNEW THAT WE COULD NOT COMPLY WITH IT.  THERE HAVE\nBEEN SEVERAL LETTERS OF INTENT WE DID NOT COMPLY WITH.\n\n   WHAT POLICY WILL WE FOLLOW IN THE FUTURE?  THE PRESIDENT DEFINED IT IN\nHIS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS ON 8 JULY.  HE SAID WE HAVE A HEAVY BURDEN, A DEBT\nTHAT WAS UNWISELY CONTRACTED, BUT IT IS A COMMITMENT OF HONOR.  HE USED\nWORDS THAT WERE COMMON IN ARGENTINA IN THE PAST.  \n\n   IT WAS ONCE SAID: WE WILL COMPLY WITH OUR COMMITMENTS, EVEN AT THE COST\nOF HUNGER AND THIRST FOR THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE.  THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS\nOWN COMMITMENT ON THIS SUBJECT.  WE WILL PAY ACCORDING TO THE CAPABILITY OF\nTHE NATION, AND THE ONLY THING WE REQUIRE IS A BIT OF TIME AND, OF COURSE,\nFLEXIBILITY ON THE PART OF OUR CREDITORS.\n\n   IF WE DID NOT HONOR OUR COMMITMENTS, IF WE HAD SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO\nPAY, THE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY WOULD BE DRAMATICALLY WORSE.  WE WOULD BE\nISOLATED.  WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN CREDITS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO\nOBTAIN FOREIGN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.  IN A WORD, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO\nINTEGRATE THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH IS QUICKLY EXPANDING AND\nPROGRESSING.  WE WOULD BE MUCH MORE BACKWARD THAN WE ARE TODAY.  THEREFORE\nTHERE IS REALLY NO QUESTION OF PAYING OR NOT PAYING.  THE HONOR OF THE\nCOUNTRY IS AT STAKE.\n\n   WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE FOREIGN DEBT IN OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY?  YOU KNOW\nTHAT WE HAVE EVERYTHING NECESSARY.  WE HAVE NATURAL RESOURCES, FOOD, ENERGY,\nFISHING, MINING, ETC.  WE HAVE HUMAN RESOURCES.  YOU KNOW THAT WHEN\nARGENTINES WORK ABROAD THEY ARE EFFICIENT AND THEY ARE RECOGNIZED AS SUCH.\nWE HAVE NO INTERNAL RELIGIOUS, RACIAL, OR INDIAN PROBLEMS, NOT EVEN PROBLEMS\nWITH OUR NEIGHBORS.\n\n   WHAT ARE WE MISSING?  WHY ARE WE WHERE WE ARE, AND WHY CAN'T WE SURVIVE?\nWE NEED TWO THINGS: FIRST, WE NEED AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC ORDER.  WE LIVE\nIN A DEEP ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISORDER.  SECOND, WE NEED CAPITAL.  CAPITAL\nIS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.\n\n   I SAID THAT I WAS GOING TO DISCUSS THE SAVINGS IN ARGENTINA THAT CAN BE\nTAPPED.  FOR YEARS, ARGENTINA'S SAVINGS HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY PUNISHED BY\nGOVERNMENT ACTIONS, SUCH AS ABUSIVE TAXES, MANDATORY SAVINGS, AND, ABOVE\nALL, THE GREAT EROSION CAUSED BY INFLATION THAT DESTROYS THE CURRENCY.  JUST\nREMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE CHANGED OUR CURRENCY.  TO PROTECT THEMSELVES\nFROM THESE LOSSES, WHAT DID SAVERS DO?  THEY EITHER TOOK THEIR MONEY ABROAD\nOR HID IT UNDER THEIR MATTRESSES.  WE WILL FOCUS TODAY ON THE MONEY UNDER THE\nMATTRESSES, ALTHOUGH WHAT I WILL SAY NOW WILL ALSO BE RELEVANT FOR THOSE WHO\nHAVE THEIR SAVINGS ABROAD.  ACCORDING TO CALCULATIONS, THERE ARE SMALL,\nMEDIUM, AND LARGE SAVINGS ADDING UP TO NEARLY $5 BILLION IN THE COUNTRY.  A\nPERSON WAS ASSAULTED IN CORDOBA THE OTHER DAY AND $250,000 WAS FOUND IN HIS\nMATTRESS.  MONEY UNDER THE MATTRESS IS AT RISK, DOES NOT ACCRUE INTEREST,\nDOES NOT WORK FOR THE COUNTRY, AND DOES NOT GIVE ANY BENEFIT TO THE OWNERS\nNOR THE COUNTRY.\n\n   SOME OF OUR HOPE LIES IN THESE SAVINGS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY,\nBECAUSE THEY REPRESENT A RESERVE THAT WE HAVE ON HAND.  WE ARE NOT\nBANKRUPT.  WE HAVE THOSE RESERVES, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT WORKING.  THE\nSECRET IS TO USE THEM FOR THE COUNTRY'S BENEFIT.  ARGENTINA'S PROBLEMS CAN\nBE RESOLVED IF THESE SAVINGS ARE USED.  NOW, TO TAP INTO THESE SAVINGS, THE\nGOVERNMENT HAS MADE A DECISION, AND THE CENTRAL BANK HAS ALREADY TRANSLATED\nIT INTO A RESOLUTION.  INTO BANKS HERE IN THE COUNTRY IN DOLLARS, YEN,\nDEUTSCHE MARKS, OR ANY OTHER CURRENCY.  THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE\nWITHDRAWALS WHENEVER THEY WANT IN THE SAME CURRENCY IN WHICH THEIR SAVINGS\nWERE DEPOSITED.  NOBODY WILL BE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THEM.  THIS WILL BE\nREINFORCED BY A LAW GRANTING SAVERS THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEE THAT NO PUBLIC\nPOWER CAN INTERVENE IN THOSE SAVINGS; THAT IS, THERE WILL BE A FINANCIAL\nSYSTEM INTO WHICH THOSE SAVINGS, IN ANY CURRENCY, CAN BE PLACED FOR THE\nBENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY AND, OF COURSE, THE DEPOSITOR.  ANYBODY WHO HAS\n$10,000 UNDER HIS MATTRESS CAN TAKE IT OUT, GO TO THE BANK, AND, UNDER THE\nGUARANTEE OF THE BANK -- NOT THE CENTRAL BANK OR THE NATION, WHICH HAVE BEEN\nDISCREDITED -- THE MONEY WILL BE AT HIS DISPOSAL AT ANY TIME.  THE BANK WILL\nLEND THE MONEY FOR EXPORT OPERATIONS AND FOR MOVING THE COUNTRY'S WEALTH.\nNEW BLOOD WILL THUS HAVE BEEN INJECTED INTO THE ARGENTINE FINANCIAL SYSTEM.\n\n   I POINT OUT THAT THE LAW WILL GIVE MAXIMUM GUARANTEES. NO PUBLIC POWER\nWILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEIZE THE SAVINGS, NOR FREEZE THEM, NOR POSTPONE\nTHEIR WITHDRAWAL.  THESE ARE THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEES THAT CAN BE GIVEN; MORE\nIS IMPOSSIBLE.  EACH ARGENTINE MUST NOW THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS.  IT HAS\nA CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE, BECAUSE IT INJECTS BLOOD INTO THE SOCIAL BODY; IT\nMOVES THE COUNTRY.  MOREOVER, FROM THE MORAL STANDPOINT, IF WE DO NOT DO\nTHIS, HOW CAN WE GO ABROAD AND ASK FOREIGNERS TO INVEST IN ARGENTINA -- TO\nBRING THEIR MONEY TO ARGENTINA -- IF AT THE SAME TIME I DO NOT INVEST HERE\nBECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE IN MY COUNTRY? THIS IS AN IMMORAL POSITION.\n\n   IF WE MAKE THE INITIAL EFFORT AND DEPOSIT $2, 3 OR 4 BILLION IN THE\nCOUNTRY, OUR NEGOTIATIONS ABROAD TAKE A NEW TWIST, BECAUSE WE CAN SAY THAT\nTHE ARGENTINES HAVE MADE THE FIRST EFFORT.  ALL THIS NATURALLY DEPENDS ON\nCONFIDENCE, AND CONFIDENCE IN TURN DEPENDS ON TAKING THIS FIRST STEP.  THIS\nIS A RECIPROCAL EFFECT.  TO CREATE CONFIDENCE, MEASURES SUCH AS THOSE\nADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CENTRAL BANK HAVE TO BE ADOPTED.  THESE\nMEASURES CREATE CONFIDENCE, AND WITH CONFIDENCE THE COUNTRY WILL QUICKLY\nRECOVER.  WE HAVE MANY OTHER THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS, BUT WITHIN THE\nLIMITATION OF TIME, WE CAN STOP HERE.",

IT INCLUDES AN INCREASE IN LAND AND AIR PATROLS AND\nSEARCHES OF BUSES AND PRIVATE VEHICLES.\n\n   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) OFFENSIVE HAS BEEN\nLAUNCHED TO PROTEST THE GOVERNMENT'S LATEST ECONOMIC MEASURES, INCLUDING THE\nDEREGULATION OF STAPLE PRICES, THE PRIVATIZATION OF COFFEE EXPORTS AND\nBANKING ACTIVITIES, AND AN INCREASE IN BUS FARES AND ELECTRICITY BILLS.\n\n   COL HERNANDEZ SAID: \"THE GOVERNMENT WANTS WHAT IS BEST FOR THE PEOPLE, SO\nLAND TRANSPORTATION USERS WILL LOGICALLY BE AFFECTED BY THE INCREASE, BUT\nBUSINESSMEN ARE ALSO TRYING TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS.\"\n\n   A CLANDESTINE REBEL STATION ASSERTED THAT THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT IN\nMORAZAN, USULUTAN, METAPAN, SAN MIGUEL, CABANAS, SAN VICENTE, LA PAZ, SAN\nSALVADOR, AND THE CONFLICT-RIDDEN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT.\n\n   THE ARMED FORCES CLAIMED THEY HAD NO INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF\nCASUALTIES OR THE CLASHES ANNOUNCED BY THE FMLN AND ASSERTED THAT, CONTRARY\nTO THE FMLN REPORT, THREE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS HAD DIED AND FIVE HAD BEEN\nKILLED IN VARIOUS CLASHES THAT OCCURRED IN NORTHERN AND EASTERN TOWNS, AND\nIN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL.  \n\n   NEVERTHELESS, THE ARMY RECOGNIZED THAT TWO SOLDIERS AND TWO CIVILIANS HAD\nDIED, AND FOUR WERE WOUNDED IN ATTACKS ON ARMY POSITIONS AND IN AMBUSHES\nAGAINST ARMY AND GOVERNMENT VEHICLES.  \n\n   THE REBELS ALSO INCREASED THEIR SABOTAGE ACTIVITIES AGAINST THE\nELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM AND BLEW UP A STILL UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF\nSTRUCTURES AND TELEPHONE EXCHANGE BOXES IN SAN SALVADOR. THEY ALSO ANNOUNCED\nTHAT THEY HAVE PLACED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES ON SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S MAIN\nHIGHWAYS.  ",

      "text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 31 JUL 89 (EL MUNDO) -- [TEXT] \"I DO NOT WANT TO\nINTERFERE AT ALL.  THE JUDGE WILL PRONOUNCE THE VERDICT; MEANWHILE, I\nWILL WAIT AND KEEP SILENT,\" MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY\nBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, SAID YESTERDAY REGARDING HIS BROTHER SHORTLY\nAFTER ENDING SUNDAY'S [30 JULY] HOMILY AT THE CATHEDRAL.\n\n   THE PRELATE WAS REFERRING TO THE ARREST OF SALOMON ENRIQUE ROSA CHAVEZ,\nWHO WAS TURNED OVER TO THE FIRST CRIMINAL COURT BY THE NATIONAL POLICE AND\nACCUSED OF BELONGING TO THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY (ERP).  THE FIRST\nCRIMINAL COURT JUDGE ORDERED HIS TEMPORARY ARREST FOLLOWING A 72 - HOUR\nPERIOD, AS ESTABLISHED BY LAW FOR CRIMES OF BEARING COUNTERFEIT DOCUMENTS\nAND FOR BRIBERY; THESE CRIMES DO NOT REQUIRE A PRISON SENTENCE.\n\n   THE AUXILIARY BISHOP SAID:  \"I HAVE REMAINED SILENT OUT OF RESPECT FOR\nTHE LEGAL PROCESS, WHICH IS STILL UNDER WAY.  MY BROTHER IS STILL IN PRISON,\nAND THAT IS WHY I PREFER TO WAIT FOR THE PROCESS TO END,\" HE SAID.  THE\nPRISONER WAS NOT RELEASED ON SATURDAY, BUT HE WILL BE RELASED ON MONDAY, 7\nAUGUST.\n\n   ASKED BY REPORTERS IF THE CHARGES MADE AGAINST HIS BROTHER WOULD HURT HIS\n[MSGR ROSA CHAVEZ'S] IMAGE OR THAT OF THE CHURCH, HE SAID THAT THE CHURCH'S\nDUTY TO THE COUNTRY IS DIFFICULT TO FULFILL BUT THAT THE CHURCH'S EFFORTS\nMUST CONTINUE, BECAUSE THE HUGE NUMBER OF PARISHIONERS WHO COME TO THE\nCATHEDRAL EVERY SUNDAY TO EASE THEIR PAINS CANNOT BE ABANDONED.\n\n   \"A SHEPHERD SHOULD NEVER LEAVE HIS FLOCK, AND, WHEN THERE ARE PROBLEMS,\nWE WILL CALMLY DEAL WITH THEM, BECAUSE THAT IS PART OF OUR MISSION,\" HE SAID.\n\n   THE PRELATE EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN OVER THE SERIES OF CONTROVERSIES THAT\nAROSE DURING THE WEEK, SUCH AS THE CHARGES AND THE COUNTERCHARGES.  HE SAID\nTHAT THE MOST SERIOUS THING IS THE \"CASE OF MSGR ROMERO,\" WHOSE MEMORY\nCONTINUES TO INSPIRE MANY AND IS A NIGHTMARE FOR THE MASTERMINDS AND\nPERPETRATORS OF HIS ABOMINABLE ASSASSINATION.  \n\n   THESE CHARGES WERE MADE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL BY FORMER PRESIDENT DUARTE,\nCURRENT ADMINISTRATION MEMBERS, AND WELL-KNOWN POLITICAL FIGURES.  ROSA\nCHAVEZ REFERRED TO THE CHARGES FILED BY ATTORNEY GENERAL DR MAURICIO ERNESTO\nCOLORADO, WHO LAST WEEK ASKED THE FIRST TREASURY COURT JUDGE TO DRAW UP AN\nINDICTMENT AGAINST JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY, AND A\nCHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER.\n\n   THE AUXILIARY BISHOP SAID:  \"I GREATLY REGRET THE FACT THAT THIS\nATMOSPHERE IS ONE OF -- I ACCUSE YOU, YOU ACCUSE ME, AND WE ACCUSE EACH\nOTHER.  THAT IS NO WAY TO MAKE PROGRESS, BECAUSE PEOPLE EXPECT THEIR LEADERS\nTO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE AND SERIOUS.  OTHERWISE, WHAT WILL THOSE OF US WHO\nARE UNDERLINGS LEARN?  THAT IS WHY I HAVE EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR ALL OF US\nTO HELP CLEAR THE AIR SO THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THE PEACE FOR WHICH WE ALL\nYEARN.\"\n\n   MSGR ROSA CHAVEZ CONGRATULATED ALL JOURNALISTS IN HIS HOMILY AND SAID:\n\"I REMIND ALL JOURNALISTS -- AS POPE JOHN PAUL II ONCE SAID -- THAT NEWS, IF\nONE THINKS ABOUT IT, IS NEVER IMPARTIAL, BECAUSE IT AT LEAST INTENTIONALLY\nAND IMPLICITLY RESPONDS TO IMPORTANT MATTERS.  JOURNALISM PROVIDES AN\nINTIMATE LINK BETWEEN THE NEWS, EDUCATION, AND ESSENTIAL VALUES.  ALMOST ALL\nMEN AND WOMEN WORKING FOR THE PRESS, RADIO, AND TELEVISION MEDIA MUST TRY TO\nACCOMPLISH THIS TASK.  HOWEVER, EACH DAY THEY NEED COURAGE AND MUST HAVE\nMUCH LOVE FOR THIS PEOPLE, WHO HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY, SO THAT THEY WILL\nREMAIN LOYAL TO THE VALUES OF THEIR PROFESSION.  THAT IS WHY OUR\nCONGRATULATION MESSAGE BECOMES A PRAYER FOR THE LORD TO PROTECT THEM AND\nHELP THEM NOT TO GIVE IN DURING DIFFICULT TIMES.\"   ",

      "text": "   TEGUCIGALPA, 3 AUG 89 (CADENA AUDIO VIDEO) -- [REPORT] [MIRIAM\nMERCADO] [EXCERPTS] RAMON CUSTODIO LOPEZ, PRESIDENT OF THE HUMAN\nRIGHTS DEFENSE COMMITTEE [CODEH] HAS PREDICTED THAT THE TELA SUMMIT\nWILL BE CHAOTIC BECAUSE, IN HIS OPINION, THE HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN\nGOVERNMENTS WILL INTERFERE.  THE CODEH PRESIDENT ALSO REVEALED THAT\nTHE BATTALION 3-16'S NEW NAME IS THE COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION AND\nITS COMMANDER IS COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ.  CUSTODIO SAID THIS\nDURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE HE HELD 2 AUGUST.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CUSTODIO] WE HAVE CALLED THIS NEWS CONFERENCE\nBECAUSE WE WANT TO WARN THE PEOPLE, THE FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WHO ARE\nHERE, AND THE OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE\nOF INSECURITY WHICH AFFLICTS THE HONDURAN PEOPLE.\n\n   FIRST OF ALL, WE WILL MENTION THE ASSASSINATIONS WHICH OCCURRED IN JULY\nAT SAN PEDRO SULA: EDUARDO HERRERA, SALOMON VALLECILLO, AND DR RAMON ROBERTO\nGARAY.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ASSASSINATIONS WERE PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS\nSO WE WOULD LIKE A JUDGE TO CALL THE NEW COMMANDER OF BATTALION 3-16 -- NOW\nCALLED COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION -- COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ TO\nTESTIFY.  THERE ARE REPORTS THAT A MEMBER OF THE 3-16TH BATTALION CONTACTED\nSALOMON VALLECILLO PRIOR TO HIS DEATH.\n\n   LIKEWISE, I WANT TO MENTION HOW THE CITIZENRY IS EXPOSED TO POLICE\nBRUTALITY.  THERE IS THE CASE OF JUSTO PASTOR ESCOBAR SILVA, WHO WAS\nASSASSINATED BY A FUSEP [PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES] AGENT WHO IS NOW\nSERVING A PRISON SENTENCE.\n\n   FURTHERMORE, PEOPLE FEEL INSECURE IN THE COUNTRY, AND I WILL\nMENTION A CASE WHICH OCCURRED 3 WEEKS AGO.  DR MARCO ANTONIO BOGRAN\nWAS TAKEN WITH ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYEES TO THE DNI [DEPARTMENT OF\nNATIONAL INVESTIGATION] AND HELD FROM 0800 TO 1500.  HE WAS NOT\nALLOWED TO CALL HIS LAWYER OR HIS RELATIVES, AND HE WAS HELD IN\nISOLATION.  HE WAS NATURALLY AFRAID THE WORST WOULD HAPPEN.  NO ONE\nEXPLAINED ANYTHING UNTIL THE END.  HE WAS TOLD THAT SOMEONE HAD\nREPORTEDLY MADE A SUBVERSIVE PHONE CALL FROM HIS HOUSE.  THIS MEANS\nTHAT HIS TELEPHONE IS BEING ILLEGALLY TAPPED BECAUSE NO ONE HERE HAS\nTHE RIGHT TO CONTROL ANYONE'S CALLS. THE MILITARY MEN IN CHARGE OF\nHONDUTEL [HONDURAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTERPRISE] ILLEGALLY ABUSE\nTHEIR POWER WHEN THEY HEAR AND CONTROL TELEPHONE CALLS BECAUSE THIS\nSHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]\n[END RECORDING]\n\n   COLONEL MANUEL ENRIQUE SUAREZ BENAVIDES, CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES PUBLIC\nRELATIONS OFFICE, HAS REACTED TO CUSTODIO LOPEZ' STATEMENT.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [COL SUAREZ] I HAVE HEARD PART OF RAMON\nCUSTODIO'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON CODEH FOREIGN POLICY, AND WE OBSERVED\nHIS ANIMOSITY TOWARD THE CONTRAS AND HIS AFFECTION FOR THE FARABUNDO\nMARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN EL SALVADOR.  WE THOUGHT HE ONLY\nHANDLED HUMAN RIGHTS BUT WE SEE HE ALSO DELVES IN FOREIGN POLICY.\nHOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THE MAIN ISSUE.\n\n   I WANT TO REFER TO THE FACT THAT YEARS AGO WE PUBLICLY PROVED THAT\nBATTALION 3-16, WHICH HE MENTIONED SO MANY TIMES, HAD BEEN DISMANTLED SO THE\nUNIT NO LONGER EXISTS.  NEVERTHELESS, HE SEEMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THIS, OR HE\nMAY BE INTENTIONALLY FORGETTING THIS.  THE UNIT DISAPPEARED BUT THE\nCOUNTERINTELLIGENCE BATTALION HE MENTIONS DOES EXIST AND ITS COMMANDER,\nWHICH HE MENTIONS, IS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES.  IN OTHER WORDS, HE HAS\nABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTIVITIES THAT BATTALION 3-16 REPORTEDLY\nCARRIED OUT.  IF CUSTODIO WANTS IT, WE CAN SEND HIM A COPY OF THE AGREEMENTS\nTO DISMANTLE BATTALION 3-16 AND TO APPOINT THE CURRENT COMMANDER OF THE\nCOUNTERINTELLIGENCE BATTALION, WHICH HAS EXISTED FOR MANY YEARS.  THAT IS\nALL.  I WANTED TO CLARIFY THIS AND I HOPE DR CUSTODIO IS MORE OBJECTIVE IN\nHIS STATEMENTS.  I SOMETIMES BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM OF BEING ON ONE SIDE\n[WORDS INDISTINCT] THE MIND.\n\n   [REPORTER] COLONEL, WHEN WILL THE ARMED FORCES BE ABLE TO GIVE THE\nHONDURAN PEOPLE EXACT INFORMATION ON THE LATEST PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN\nREPORTED MISSING IN OUR COUNTRY?\n\n   [COL SUAREZ] EXCUSE ME, I CAN HARDLY HEAR YOU.\n\n   [REPORTER] I ASKED: WHEN CAN THE HONDURAN PEOPLE HAVE EXACT\nINFORMATION ON THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN REPORTED MISSING IN THE\nCOUNTRY?\n\n   [COL SUAREZ] LOOK, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL SHORTLY, AND I AM\nTALKING ABOUT A SHORT TIME, HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR THE HONDURAN\nPEOPLE ON THE PERSONS YOU HAVE MENTIONED BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS\nCONTINUE.  THE POLICE ARREST PEOPLE BASED ON THE SUSPICION OR HARD,\nRATIONAL EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL ACTIONS.  I\nBELIEVE YOU WILL SOON HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION ON THE PERSONS WHO HAVE\nBEEN ARRESTED BY THE POLICE.  [END RECORDING]",

      "text": "   TEGUCIGALPA, 3 AUG 89 (CADENA AUDIO VIDEO) -- [REPORT] [MIRIAM\nMERCADO] [EXCERPTS] RAMON CUSTODIO LOPEZ, PRESIDENT OF THE HUMAN\nRIGHTS DEFENSE COMMITTEE [CODEH] HAS PREDICTED THAT THE TELA SUMMIT\nWILL BE CHAOTIC BECAUSE, IN HIS OPINION, THE HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN\nGOVERNMENTS WILL INTERFERE.  THE CODEH PRESIDENT ALSO REVEALED THAT\nTHE BATTALION 3-16'S NEW NAME IS THE COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION AND\nITS COMMANDER IS COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ.  CUSTODIO SAID THIS\nDURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE HE HELD 2 AUGUST.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CUSTODIO] WE HAVE CALLED THIS NEWS CONFERENCE\nBECAUSE WE WANT TO WARN THE PEOPLE, THE FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WHO ARE\nHERE, AND THE OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE\nOF INSECURITY WHICH AFFLICTS THE HONDURAN PEOPLE.\n\n   FIRST OF ALL, WE WILL MENTION THE ASSASSINATIONS WHICH OCCURRED IN JULY\nAT SAN PEDRO SULA: EDUARDO HERRERA, SALOMON VALLECILLO, AND DR RAMON ROBERTO\nGARAY.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ASSASSINATIONS WERE PERPETRATED BY PROFESSIONALS\nSO WE WOULD LIKE A JUDGE TO CALL THE NEW COMMANDER OF BATTALION 3-16 -- NOW\nCALLED COUNTERINSURGENCY BATTALION -- COLONEL ALBERTO ANDINO BENITEZ TO\nTESTIFY.  THERE ARE REPORTS THAT A MEMBER OF THE 3-16TH BATTALION CONTACTED\nSALOMON VALLECILLO PRIOR TO HIS DEATH.\n\n   LIKEWISE, I WANT TO MENTION HOW THE CITIZENRY IS EXPOSED TO POLICE\nBRUTALITY.  THERE IS THE CASE OF JUSTO PASTOR ESCOBAR SILVA, WHO WAS\nASSASSINATED BY A FUSEP [PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES] AGENT WHO IS NOW\nSERVING A PRISON SENTENCE.\n\n   FURTHERMORE, PEOPLE FEEL INSECURE IN THE COUNTRY, AND I WILL\nMENTION A CASE WHICH OCCURRED 3 WEEKS AGO.  DR MARCO ANTONIO BOGRAN\nWAS TAKEN WITH ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYEES TO THE DNI [DEPARTMENT OF\nNATIONAL INVESTIGATION] AND HELD FROM 0800 TO 1500.  HE WAS NOT\nALLOWED TO CALL HIS LAWYER OR HIS RELATIVES, AND HE WAS HELD IN\nISOLATION.  HE WAS NATURALLY AFRAID THE WORST WOULD HAPPEN.  NO ONE\nEXPLAINED ANYTHING UNTIL THE END.  HE WAS TOLD THAT SOMEONE HAD\nREPORTEDLY MADE A SUBVERSIVE PHONE CALL FROM HIS HOUSE.  THIS MEANS\nTHAT HIS TELEPHONE IS BEING ILLEGALLY TAPPED BECAUSE NO ONE HERE HAS\nTHE RIGHT TO CONTROL ANYONE'S CALLS. THE MILITARY MEN IN CHARGE OF\nHONDUTEL [HONDURAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTERPRISE] ILLEGALLY ABUSE\nTHEIR POWER WHEN THEY HEAR AND CONTROL TELEPHONE CALLS BECAUSE THIS\nSHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]\n[END RECORDING]\n\n   COLONEL MANUEL ENRIQUE SUAREZ BENAVIDES, CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES PUBLIC\nRELATIONS OFFICE, HAS REACTED TO CUSTODIO LOPEZ' STATEMENT.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [COL SUAREZ] I HAVE HEARD PART OF RAMON\nCUSTODIO'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON CODEH FOREIGN POLICY, AND WE OBSERVED\nHIS ANIMOSITY TOWARD THE CONTRAS AND HIS AFFECTION FOR THE FARABUNDO\nMARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT IN EL SALVADOR.  WE THOUGHT HE ONLY\nHANDLED HUMAN RIGHTS BUT WE SEE HE ALSO DELVES IN FOREIGN POLICY.\nHOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THE MAIN ISSUE.\n\n   I WANT TO REFER TO THE FACT THAT YEARS AGO WE PUBLICLY PROVED THAT\nBATTALION 3-16, WHICH HE MENTIONED SO MANY TIMES, HAD BEEN DISMANTLED SO THE\nUNIT NO LONGER EXISTS.  NEVERTHELESS, HE SEEMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THIS, OR HE\nMAY BE INTENTIONALLY FORGETTING THIS.  THE UNIT DISAPPEARED BUT THE\nCOUNTERINTELLIGENCE BATTALION HE MENTIONS DOES EXIST AND ITS COMMANDER,\nWHICH HE MENTIONS, IS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES.  IN OTHER WORDS, HE HAS\nABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTIVITIES THAT BATTALION 3-16 REPORTEDLY\nCARRIED OUT.  IF CUSTODIO WANTS IT, WE CAN SEND HIM A COPY OF THE AGREEMENTS\nTO DISMANTLE BATTALION 3-16 AND TO APPOINT THE CURRENT COMMANDER OF THE\nCOUNTERINTELLIGENCE BATTALION, WHICH HAS EXISTED FOR MANY YEARS.  THAT IS\nALL.  I WANTED TO CLARIFY THIS AND I HOPE DR CUSTODIO IS MORE OBJECTIVE IN\nHIS STATEMENTS.  I SOMETIMES BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM OF BEING ON ONE SIDE\n[WORDS INDISTINCT] THE MIND.\n\n   [REPORTER] COLONEL, WHEN WILL THE ARMED FORCES BE ABLE TO GIVE THE\nHONDURAN PEOPLE EXACT INFORMATION ON THE LATEST PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN\nREPORTED MISSING IN OUR COUNTRY?\n\n   [COL SUAREZ] EXCUSE ME, I CAN HARDLY HEAR YOU.\n\n   [REPORTER] I ASKED: WHEN CAN THE HONDURAN PEOPLE HAVE EXACT\nINFORMATION ON THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN REPORTED MISSING IN THE\nCOUNTRY?\n\n   [COL SUAREZ] LOOK, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL SHORTLY, AND I AM\nTALKING ABOUT A SHORT TIME, HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR THE HONDURAN\nPEOPLE ON THE PERSONS YOU HAVE MENTIONED BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS\nCONTINUE.  THE POLICE ARREST PEOPLE BASED ON THE SUSPICION OR HARD,\nRATIONAL EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL ACTIONS.  I\nBELIEVE YOU WILL SOON HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION ON THE PERSONS WHO HAVE\nBEEN ARRESTED BY THE POLICE.  [END RECORDING]",

WE CENTRAL\nAMERICANS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE BEING KILLED, NOT THE U.S.  SOLDIERS.\nTHE UNITED STATES HAS THE DUTY TO RESPECT DECISIONS MADE BY THE\nCENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLES AND GOVERNMENTS.\n\n   [REPORTER] WHAT ARE THE REAL BASES OF THE AGREEMENT REACHED WITH THE\nNICARAGUAN OPPOSITION?\n\n   [ORTEGA] IT IS A DOCUMENT THAT WAS SIGNED BY ALL POLITICAL PARTIES.\nOBVIOUSLY, I SIGNED IT MYSELF.  THE MAIN POINT IN THE DOCUMENT IS THAT WE\nPROPOSE THE DISMANTLING OF THE CONTRAS.  THAT WAS THE FIRST ISSUE WE\nDISCUSSED.  THE DOCUMENT NOTES THAT ONCE THE CONTRAS ARE DISMANTLED, THERE\nWILL BE AN AMNESTY, AND PRISONERS REMAINING IN NICARAGUA WILL BE RELEASED.\nWE ALSO STRESSED THAT FOREIGN FORCES SHOULD NOT MEDDLE IN THE NICARAGUAN\nELECTION PROCESS; THE CIA, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO MEDDLE IN THE\nNICARAGUAN ELECTION PROCESS; THIS WAS DISCUSSED AT THE U.S.  CONGRESS.\nTHEREFORE, WE ARE AGAINST THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY, WHICH SHOWS DISRESPECT FOR\nNICARAGUAN SOVEREIGNTY.\n\n   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] CONCERNING [WORDS INDISTINCT].\nHOWEVER, IS IT NOT ALSO NECESSARY TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE CONTRAS?\n\n   [ORTEGA] WHAT DID YOU SAY?  THAT WE MUST TALK TO THE CONTRAS?\n\n   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO TALK TO THE\nCONTRAS?  \n\n   [ORTEGA] WELL, WE WILL HAVE TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE CONTRAS TO FIND\nOUT HOW THEY CAN BE DISLODGED [FROM HONDURAS] AND RETURN TO NICARAGUA;\nOR WE MUST DISCUSS WHETHER THEY WANT TO STAY HERE IN HONDURAS --\nBECAUSE SOME MAY WANT TO STAY IN HONDURAS AND OTHERS MAY WANT TO GO\nELSEWHERE, SUCH AS TO THE UNITED STATES.  I BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED\nSTATES SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT TO STAY IN CENTRAL\nAMERICA, BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES PROMOTED THE CONTRAS.  THE UNITED\nSTATES SHOULD NOT PLACE THIS BURDEN ON HONDURAS OR ON THE OTHER\nCENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  THEREFORE, WE WILL HAVE TO HOLD TALKS\nWITH THE CONTRAS TO GET THEM OUT OF HERE, TO GET THEM OUT OF HERE IN\nAN ORDERLY MANNER AND NOT BY SHOOTING AT THEM.\n\n   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, THE CONTRAS ARE DEMANDING GUARANTEES.  \n\n   [ORTEGA] GUARANTEES ALREADY EXIST IN NICARAGUA.  \n\n   [REPORTER] COMMANDER ORTEGA, DO YOU HELP THE FARABUNDO MARTI\nNATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN]?  \n\n   [ORTEGA] WHAT?  \n\n   [REPORTER] DO YOU PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN?  \n\n   [ORTEGA] WE ARE IN FAVOR OF A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION.\n\n   [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] SAID IT HAS EVIDENCE THAT NICARAGUA\nPROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO THE FMLN.  THIS WAS SAID YESTERDAY BY\nNICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER MIGUEL D'ESCOTO.\n\n   [ANNOUNCER] THE STATEMENTS BY COMMANDER DANIEL ORTEGA HAVE BEEN\nINTERRUPTED BECAUSE THE PLANE THAT BROUGHT HIM TO THE AIRPORT IS ABOUT TO\nTAKE OFF FROM THE TELA AIRPORT.  AT THIS TIME, THE HONDURAN FOREIGN MINISTER\nIS ASKING MR ORTEGA TO GO TO [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THE FOREIGN MINISTER IS\nTRYING TO CONVINCE ORTEGA TO STOP MAKING STATEMENTS, BUT MR ORTEGA SEEMS\nVERY WILLING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS.  AT THIS MOMENT,\nPRESIDENT ORTEGA CANNOT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS BEING POSED BY LOCAL AND\nFOREIGN NEWSMEN BECAUSE THE PLANE IS TAKING OFF.\n\n   [REPORTER] MR ORTEGA...  \n\n   [ORTEGA] INTERRUPTING CONCERNING YOUR QUESTION A FEW MINUTES AGO\nREGARDING THE FMLN.  I JUST HELD A MEETING; I JUST HELD A MEETING WITH\nTHE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND.  THEY ARE TOURING THE AREA, AND I HAVE MET\nTHEM.  THEY GAVE ME A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN\nPRESIDENTS EXPRESSING THEIR WILLINGNESS TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE WITH THE\nSALVADORAN GOVERNMENT, USING AS A BASIS THE DIALOGUE THAT THE FMLN HAS\nHELD WITH THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES IN EL SALVADOR.  THE FLMN\nRECENTLY MET WITH THE LEGALLY REGISTERED POLITICAL PARTIES IN EL\nSALVADOR.  THE FMLN HAS MET WITH SOCIAL GROUPS, AND, AFTER THESE\nTALKS, THEY MADE A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL: TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE TO REACH A\nNEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE\nENDURING.  OUR DESIRE IS TO SUPPORT A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION -- AS\nESTABLISHED IN THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS - - TO FIND A NEGOTIATED\nSOLUTION TO THIS KIND OF CENTRAL AMERICAN CONFLICT.  [CONTINUED]",

WE HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY WORKING ON THAT\nAGREEMENT SO THAT A FINAL AGREEMENT CAN BE ISSUED. WE HAVE PREPARED\nDOCUMENTS ON WHICH, I WOULD SAY, THERE IS A CERTAIN CONSENSUS--SUCH AS\nON THE DOCUMENT ON THE [WORD INDISTINCT] OF THE CONTRAS, THE DOCUMENT\nON THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN AGREEMENT CONCERNING THE SUIT NICARAGUA HAS\nFILED BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE, THE SALVADORAN ISSUE,\nAND OTHER POINTS.\n\n   I THINK THERE IS A POLITICAL RESOLVE ON THE PART OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN\nPRESIDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMETHING POSITIVE EMERGES FROM THIS SUMMIT. I\nAM SURE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS HOPING THAT NOTHING WILL RESULT FROM\nTHIS SUMMIT. I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY\nEXERTING STRONG PRESSURES SO THAT NOTHING WILL COME FROM THIS SUMMIT.\n\n   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT: WHAT ARE THE PROCEDURES FOR NICARAGUA'S\nWITHDRAWAL OF ITS SUIT AGAINST HONDURAS?  \n\n   [ORTEGA] THIS HAS TO BE LINKED TO COMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PLAN FOR\nTHE CONTRA WITHDRAWAL.  \n\n   [REPORTER] IN OTHER WORDS, THE CONTRAS MUST FIRST LEAVE?\n\n   [ORTEGA] OF COURSE.  THAT IS OUR INSURANCE.  \n\n   [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, HAS HONDURAS AGREED TO THIS?  \n\n   [ORTEGA] WE ARE EXCHANGING VIEWPOINTS ON THIS.\n\n   [REPORTER] THE SUIT REPRESENTS AN INSURANCE FOR YOU,\nCOMMANDER?  WHICH GROUPS HAS THE UNITED STATES BEEN PRESSURING?  \n\n   [ORTEGA] THE CENTRAL AMERICAN GROUPS. THERE HAVE BEEN DIRECT AND\nINDIRECT CONTACTS. THE UNITED STATES HAS CONTACTED THE CENTRAL\nAMERICAN DELEGATIONS IN HOPES THAT NO AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED. THE\nAMERICANS CONTINUE TO FAVOR THE PRESENCE OF THE CONTRAS. THE FACT THAT\nPRESIDENT BUSH MET WITH CONTRA LEADERS ON THE EVE OF THIS CENTRAL\nAMERICAN PRESIDENTS SUMMIT IS A SLAP IN THE FACE TO THIS MEETING.\n\n   [REPORTER] WHEN YOU MENTION THESE PRESSURES, MR PRESIDENT, TO WHICH\nCOUNTRIES ARE YOU REFERRING?\n\n   [ORTEGA] ALL OF THEM, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NICARAGUA. I HAVE NO DOUBTS\nTHAT RIGHT NOW THE UNITED STATES IS EXERTING PRESSURE, BECAUSE IT WANTS TO\nKILL THIS SUMMIT JUST WHEN WE ARE ABOUT TO REACH AN AGREEMENT. IF NO\nAGREEMENT IS REACHED AT THIS SUMMIT, THE UNITED STATES WILL BE RESPONSIBLE\nFOR THAT.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] BECAUSE WE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE\nSUFFICIENT AUTHORITY AND SUFFICIENT SELF-DETERMINATION AND INDEPENDENCE TO\nDECIDE OUR OWN ACTIONS.\n\n   [REPORTER] AT THIS STAGE, HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE PRESIDENTS SUMMIT?\nIS THIS SUMMIT A FAILURE OR A SUCCESS?\n\n   [ORTEGA] I THINK IT HAS TO BE A SUCCESS, EVEN IF THE UNITED STATES HAS\nNOT GIVEN UP TRYING TO MAKE IT FAIL. THIS IS THE TIME, AND I AM SURE THAT IT\nIS TRYING [WORDS INDISTINCT].",

      "text": "   BOGOTA, 7 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]\n[PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [EXCERPTS] [PASSAGE OMITTED] SIMON BOLIVAR\nAND FRANCISCO DE PAULA SANTANDER GAVE OUR ARMED FORCES THE MISSION OF\nDEFENDING FREEDOM, INDEPENDENCE, AND DEMOCRACY.  THROUGHOUT HISTORY,\nTHE NATIONAL ARMY HAS COMPLIED WITH THAT MANDATE.  IT HAS NOT BEEN AN\nEASY TASK, EVEN LESS SO DURING THE TIMES WE ARE LIVING.  VERY FEW\nNATIONS HAVE HAD TO CONFRONT SIMULTANEOUSLY SO MANY DIFFICULT\nCHALLENGES.  CONFRONTED BY A COMBINATION OF SOURCES OF DISRUPTION, THE\nARMED FORCES HAVE NOT LOST THEIR DETERMIANTION AND OPTIMISM, NOR HAVE\nTHEY STOPPED FOR 1 MINUTE TO STRUGGLE FOR THE REESTABLISHMENT OF\nTRANQUILLITY FOR THE CITIZENS, AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIFE, HONOR,\nAND PROPERTY OF COLOMBIANS.\n\n   AS THE VIOLENCE INCREASES, OUR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY AND COLOMBIA IS\nSTRENGTHENED.  THE PRICE OF COURAGE AND FIRMNESS HAS BEEN HIGH.  MANY\nSOLDIERS, OFFICERS, AND NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS HAVE BEEN KILLED, BUT THEY\nARE THE HEROES OF DEMOCRACY.  ON THE OCCASION OF ARMY DAY, I SPEAK ON BEHALF\nOF THE VAST NATIONAL MAJORITY AND CONVEY TO THEIR FAMILIES, FRIENDS, AND\nFELLOW SOLDIERS OUR MESSAGE OF ENCOURAGEMENT, APPRECIATION, AND HOPE.  THEIR\nEFFORTS HAVE NOT BEEN IN VAIN.\n\n   THE BATTLE TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY AND DEFEAT VIOLENCE CONTINUES.  THE\nDETERMINATION OF COLOMBIANS DOES NOT WEAKEN.  OUR ENEMIES ARE ALONE, AS\nNEVER BEFORE, AND THIS WE OWE TO PERMANENT ACTIONS BY OUR ARMED FORCES.\n\n   IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, I OFFERED THE COLOMBIANS A POLICY OF\nRECONCILIATION BASED ON DEFINED GUIDELINES AND CLEAR PRINCIPLES.  THIS WAS\nTHE DEMOCRATIC MANDATE THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE PEOPLE.  NOW, WHEN WE ARE\nHARVESTING THE RESULTS OF THAT STRATEGY, WE WILL NOT GIVE UP.  THE PEACE\nINITIATIVE HAS SHOWED THAT IT CAN OPERATE AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE\nFRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH WE WILL CONDUCT POLITICAL ACTION FOR NATIONAL\nRECONCILIATION.\n\n   SOME BELIEVE THAT TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY, IT IS NECESSARY TO LEAVE IT\nIDLE, AT THE MERCY OF VIOLENCE.  OTHERS ARGUE THAT PEACE CAN ONLY BE\nACHIEVED IF WE DISMANTLE OUR CAPABILITY TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY.  WE DO NOT\nAGREE.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONFIRMED THAT STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY AND THE\nQUEST FOR PEACE ARE NOT ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH IMPROVING AND STRENGTHENING THE\nARMED FORCES, BUT THAT THIS IS INDISPENSABLE FOR ADVANCING THE POLITICAL\nHANDLING OF VIOLENCE.\n\n   EFFICIENT, PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES THAT SERVE THE COUNTRY ARE A\nDEFINITE GUARANTEE OF THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS AND OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE.\nTHAT IS WHY THIS GOVERNMENT HAS MADE A GREAT ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL\nEFFORT TO RETURN TO THE MILITARY INSTITUTIONS COMPLETE FREEDOM OF ACTION.\n\n   THIS COMMEMORATION OF THE 170TH ANNIVERSARY OF OUR INDEPENDENCE IS A\nSUITABLE TIME TO PONDER OUR DUTY TO THE HOMELAND.  I AM NOT REFERRING TO\nDAILY CIVIC DUTIES, WHICH ARE PROPER TO ALL OF US COLOMBIANS, BUT TO\nSOMETHING MUCH DEEPER -- LOYALTY TO DEMOCRACY AND OUR INSTITUTIONS.\nDEMOCRACY'S BOUNDARIES ARE BROAD, BUT PRECISE.  WHEN VIOLENCE TO A CERTAIN\nEXTENT IS TOLERATED, MORE VIOLENCE IS CREATED, THERE IS A CONSPIRACY AGAINST\nPEACE, AND CONFLICTS ARE AGGRAVATED.  THE ENTIRE SOCIETY HAS SUFFERED\nBECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENEMIES OF COLOMBIA.  [PASSAGE OMITTED] \n\n   I CONGRATULATE THE OFFICERS, CIVILIAN PERSONALITIES, SERGEANT AMAYA\nALVAREZ, AND PRIVATE MALAMBO TIQUE, WHOSE MERITS WERE ACKNOWLEDGED TODAY IN\nTHE NAME OF THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND THE GOVERNMENT.  [APPLAUSE] THIS\nCEREMONY, IN WHICH WE HONOR THE HEROES OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE ARMY, IS A\nSUITABLE OCCASION TO MAKE KNOWN TO OFFICERS, NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND\nSOLDIERS ALIKE THE NATION'S RECOGNITION OF THEIR COURAGEOUS AND PROFESSIONAL\nFULFILLMENT OF THEIR DUTIES.  WHEN THE ARMED FORCES ACADEMIES PARADE BEFORE\nUS, SO WILL THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO SERVING\nTHE HOMELAND AND THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN.  EVERY HONEST COLOMBIAN SUPPORTS\nTHEM.\n\n   SOLDIERS: YOU, WHO WIELD THE NATION'S ARMS, REPRESENT THE BASIC GUARANTEE\nTHAT PRESERVES SOVEREIGNTY, LIBERTY, AND OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  THANK\nYOU.  [APPLAUSE]  ",

THIS MEANS THAT ALL 18- TO\n50-YEAR-OLD PERUVIANS ARE OF MILITARY AGE, AND WE ARE OBLIGED TO\nCOMPLY WITH THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW, IN THE RESERVE.\n\n   THEREFORE, ONE NOT ONLY COMPLIES WITH THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW WHEN ONE\nIS ASSIGNED ON ACTIVE DUTY TO A MILITARY GARRISON FOR 1 OR 2 YEARS, BUT ONE\nCONTINUES COMPLYING WITH THIS LAW BY REMAINING IN THE RESERVE UNTIL 50 YEARS\nOF AGE.\n\n   ARTICLE 272 OF THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW STATES:  MEN FROM 18 TO 50 YEARS\nOF AGE AND WOMEN BETWEEN 18 AND 45 YEARS OF AGE WHO ARE NOT ON ACTIVE\nMILITARY SERVICE ALL BELONG TO THE RESERVE, AND THEY MUST COMPLY WITH THE\nOBLIGATIONS ESTABLISHED BY CLAUSE 4 OF THIS LAW.\n\n   IF THE LAW STATES THIS, I THEN ASK ALL PERUVIANS: ARE NOT TERRORISTS --\nWHO ARE PART OF THE ARMED FORCES RESERVES AND WHO TAKE ARMS TO ATTACK THE\nNATIONAL POLICE AND ARMED FORCES -- VIOLATING THE OBLIGATORY MILITARY\nSERVICE LAW?  IS NOT HE, WHO BY VIOLENT MEANS TRIES TO DESTROY THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF WHICH THE ARMED FORCES ARE PART, VIOLATING THE\nMILITARY SERVICE LAW?\n\n   THEREFORE, SINCE ARTICLE 282 OF THE CONSTITUTION STATES THAT THOSE WHO\nVIOLATE THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW CAN BE TRIED BY THE MILITARY\nCODE OF JUSTICE, THEN TERRORISTS CAN BE TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS.\n\n   THUS THE IDEA IS THAT ONE LAW, ONE ARTICLE, SHOULD ESTABLISH THAT THE\nCRIME OF TERRORISM VIOLATES THE MILITARY SERVICE LAW, THEREFORE ENABLING A\nQUICK AND DRASTIC PUNISHMENT FOR TERRORISTS.  \n\n   IT WILL THEREFORE NOT BE NECESSARY TO AMMEND THE CONSTITUTION.  A CORRECT\nINTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION IS ALL THAT WILL BE NEEDED.  WE MUST ALSO\nREMEMBER THAT WHEN THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION WAS APPROVED THERE WAS NO\nSERIOUS TERRORIST PROBLEM.  BESIDES, YOU MUST KNOW THAT TO AMMEND THE\nCONSTITUTION WE MUST WAIT NEARLY 2 YEARS, AND WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE.\n\n   MANY PERUVIANS THINK THAT IF MILITARY COURTS TRY TERRORISTS THEY WILL BE\nSENTENCED TO DEATH.  THIS IS FALSE, IT IS NOT CORRECT.  THE MILITARY COURTS\nWILL ONLY RULE SENTENCES IN KEEPING WITH THE LAW, BUT THESE SENTENCES WILL\nBE APPLIED FIRMLY.  THIS MEANS THAT CRIMINALS WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED.\n\n   I ASK ALL PERUVIANS AND ALL INSTITUTIONS TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL.\nTERRORISTS MUST NOT REMAIN UNPUNISHED.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE DO NOT\nTRUST THE CIVILIAN COURTS.  THIS MEANS THAT WE MUST SIMPLY INTERPRET THE\nCONSTITUTION APPROPRIATELY.  TERRORISTS REALLY DO VIOLATE THEIR CONDITION AS\nARMED FORCES RESERVES WHEN THEY TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND THE\nARMED FORCES.\n\n   IT IS THEREFORE OUR PURPOSE TO DO THINGS CORRECTLY.  THE CONSTITUTION\nMUST BE INTERPRETED IN FAVOR OF PERU, SINCE IT CANNOT BE INTERPRETED IN\nFAVOR OF THE TERRORISTS.  \n\n   I AM SURPRISED THAT ON THE ONE SIDE PEOPLE CRITICIZE THE LITTLE ACTION\n TAKEN AGAINST TERRORISTS, WHILE ON THE OTHER THEY DO NOT ACCEPT A CONCRETE\nINITIATIVE LIKE THIS ONE TO PUNISH THEM.\n\n   THIS IS THE MOMENT TO RESUME THE DISCUSSION ON THIS SUBJECT BEFORE THE\nELECTION CAMPAIGNS MAKE US FORGET THAT WE ARE AT WAR AGAINST TERRORISM.  ON\nTHE CONTRARY, IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THE ELECTIONS WE MUST QUICKLY MAKE ALL\nTHE IMPORTANT DECISIONS AND APPROVE STRICT PUNISHMENTS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO\nLIVE IN DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, PEACE, AND SAFETY.

THE MAGISTRATES OF THE BOGOTA\nSUPERIOR TRIBUNAL SAID THEY DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT ADDED THAT\nTHEY DO NOT WANT TO BE THE NEXT VICTIMS EITHER.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED JUDGE] WE FEEL WE ARE WAGING A USELESS\nSTRUGGLE.  WE ARE FIGHTING FOR IDEALS THAT NOBODY SHARES.  WHAT WE WANT IS\nFOR THE COUNTRY TO BEGIN TO SHARE THOSE IDEALS.  WHEN THAT HAPPENS, WE, THE\nCOLOMBIAN JUDGES, WILL BE WILLING TO GIVE UP OUR LIVES FOR THOSE IDEALS AS\nCARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA DID. [END RECORDING]\n\n   THE 22,000 JUDICIAL BRANCH EMPLOYEES JOINED THE MAGISTRATES' PROTEST.\nTHE JUDICIAL BRANCH PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION CALLED FOR AN INDEFINITE\nSTRIKE, BEGINNING TODAY.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] THE GOVERNMENT'S PROMISES HAVE\nBEEN ONLY THAT, PROMISES.  THE TRUTH IS THAT THE PLAN TO PROVIDE PROTECTION,\nESCORTS, AND ARMORED VEHICLES HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED.\n\n   IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THAT TO END THIS WAVE OF MURDERS THE GOVERNMENT\nMUST SHOW THE POLITICAL RESOLVE TO ERADICATE IT.  THE GOVERNMENT MUST\nCONFRONT THIS PROBLEM BY USING OUR ARMED FORCES WITH DUE RESPECT FOR HUMAN\nRIGHTS.  AS LONG AS THAT IS NOT DONE, NOT ONLY JUDGES, BUT THE BEST CHILDREN\nOF COLOMBIA, WILL CONTINUE TO DIE.  [END RECORDING]\n\n   THE WIFE OF THE MURDERED MAGISTRATE ARRIVED FROM GUATEMALA TODAY FOR THE\nFUNERAL.",

      "text": "   BOGOTA, 18 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]\n[COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS] [TEXT] FELLOW COUNTRYMEN:\nI AM ADDRESSING YOU TO EXPLAIN THE MEASURES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF\nTHE STATE OF SIEGE [MEDIDAS DE ESTADO DE SITIO] WHICH HAVE BEEN\nADOPTED AT A TIME WHEN THE NATION HAS JUSTIFIED REASONS TO FEEL ANGRY\nAND MOVED BY THE SERIOUS ACTIONS OF VIOLENCE THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN\nRECENT DAYS.  UNFORTUNATELY, LUIS CARLOS GALAN, THE LIBERAL PARTY\nPRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, WAS THE VICTIM OF ANOTHER ATTACK TONIGHT.\nSENATOR GALAN HAS BEEN TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL.  LET US PRAY TO GOD THAT\nHE WILL RECOVER FROM HIS WOUNDS.\n\n   THE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THE NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS HAVE UNLEASHED A\nWAVE OF ASSASSINATIONS AND DEATHS.  THERE HAVE BEEN ATTACKS AGAINST\nREPRESENTATIVES AND LEADERS FROM ALL SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY AND FROM ALL\nINSTITUTIONS.  HIGH-RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, SEVERAL JUDGES, POLITICAL\nLEADERS, SOLDIERS, CITIZENS, AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN THE VICTIMS OF\nTHIS BARBARISM.\n\n   VIOLENCE AFFECTS ALL.  IT IS NOT AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OR\nAGAINST JUSTICE; IT IS A WAR AGAINST THE COUNTRY.  THEREFORE, THE ENTIRE\nCOUNTRY MUST RESPOND.  I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THE MURDER OF MAGISTRATE CARLOS\nVALENCIA LED THE JUDGES OF THE REPUBLIC TO PROTEST AND TO REQUEST MORE\nPROTECTION, BUT FOR THE MAGISTRATES AND JUDGES TO RESIGN ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO\nWORSENING THE SITUATION WHICH WE MUST ALL SOLVE BY WORKING TOGETHER.  THIS\nIS ALSO EQUIVALENT TO YIELDING TO THE TERRORISTS WHO ARE TRYING TO PARALYZE\nTHE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.\n\n   TRUE HEROES SUCH AS CARLOS VALENCIA, WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO, AND\nOTHER JUDGES, POLICEMEN, SOLDIERS, AND BODYGUARDS HAVE PREVENTED THIS BY\nFULFILLING THEIR DUTIES WITHOUT YIELDING TO INTIMIDATION OR BRIBERY.  I\nINVITE ALL JUDGES OF THE REPUBLIC TO RESUME THEIR WORK.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS\nADOPTED MORE MEASURES TO PROTECT THEM, AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO RENDER ALL\nTHE COOPERATION THEY REQUIRE AND WHICH IS AVAILABLE.  ALL GOOD COLOMBIANS\nMUST JOIN THE EFFORTS.  NO MORE LAMENTATIONS WITHOUT TRUE ACTION OF\nCOOPERATION WITH THE AUTHORITIES.\n\n   IT IS NECESSARY THAT ALL FORCES OF THE STATE AND OF SOCIETY -- POLITICAL\nPARTIES, UNIONS, MEDIA, CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS -- ALL SERVE JUSTICE AND THE\nSTRUGGLE AGAINST CRIME.  WE MUST BE PREPARED TO ENDURE MORE SORROW AND\nSUFFERINGS.  ONLY IF ALL COLOMBIA PERSEVERES IN A TRULY STRONG AND SOLID\nMANNER -- BUT NOT JUST WITH WORDS -- IN THE DIFFICULT BATTLE AGAINST CRIME,\nWILL WE BE ABLE TO BANISH VIOLENCE.  [CONTINUED]",

THE GOVERNMENT WILL THEN ENFORCE THOSE LAWS IN ACCORDANCE\nWITH THE CONSTITUTION.\n\n   BASED ON SPECIAL POWERS, TODAY THE GOVERNMENT ISSUED OTHER DECREES THAT\nTHE NATIONAL CONGRESS APPROVED ON A GOVERNMENT REQUEST.  I WILL MENTION ONLY\nONE OF THOSE DECREES.  THIS DECREE AMENDS OUR PENAL CODE.\n\n   THE PUBLIC NAMING OF JURORS WILL BE ELIMINATED.  ORGANIZED CRIME TOOK\nADVANTAGE OF THAT JURY APPOINTMENT SYSTEM AND AVOIDED THE ACTION OF JUSTICE\nBY INTIMIDATING JURORS.  THE NEW DECREE REDUCES FORMALITIES AND CREATES\nROVING JUDGES WHO WILL HAVE AUTHORITY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, THUS\nINCREASING THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.  THOSE JUDGES WILL JUDGE\nANY CRIME THAT WILL BE GIVEN SPECIAL IMPORTANCE FOR REASONS OF PUBLIC ORDER.\n\n   THESE MEASURES HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY STUDIED.  THAT, HOWEVER, DOES NOT MEAN\nTHEY CANNOT BE SUPPLEMENTED IN THE FUTURE IF NECESSARY.\n\n   WHEN DRAFTING THESE DECREES WE, AS USUAL, PAID DUE ATTENTION TO THE\nHONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE'S DECISIONS SO THAT THE CURRENT DECREES\nFOLLOW ALONG WITH THE GUIDELINES OF THE CONSTITUTION.\n\n   THE THREAT THAT DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND ORGANIZED CRIME REPRESENT JUSTIFIES\nTHE SEVERITY OF THE MEASURES WE HAVE ADOPTED.  COLOMBIANS CAN BE SURE WE\nWILL CONTINUE MAKING ALL THE NECESSARY EFFORTS TO REGAIN TRANQUILLITY IN\nCOLOMBIA.  I AM SURE WE WILL OVERCOME THESE DIFFICULTIES.  A HANDFUL OF\nCRIMINALS WILL NOT DEFEAT A UNIFIED NATION THAT IS WILLING TO STRUGGLE\nAGAINST CRIME.\n\n   WE ARE CERTAINLY EXPERIENCING A DIFFICULT TIME.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE\nEXPERIENCED EVEN MORE DIFFICULT SITUATIONS AND COLOMBIA OVERCAME THEM.  WE\nMUST NOT STRAY FROM OUR PATH, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE CRIMINALS WANT.  BY\nFALLING INTO DESPAIR WE WILL BE PLAYING THE TERRORISTS' GAME.  IF WE\nCONTINUE AHEAD FIRMLY AND DECISIVELY, WE WILL HAVE MUCH BETTER RESULTS.\nINSTEAD OF WASTING OUR TIME IN DISPUTES AND RECIPROCAL REPROACHES, LET US\nUNITE OUR ACTIONS AGAINST OUR COMMON ENEMY.  WE MUST WIN THIS WAR.  I AM\nSURE WE WILL SUCCEED.  GOOD EVENING AND SEE YOU SOON.",

DOES THIS OFFICIAL, WHOSE NAME YOU DO\nNOT DISCLOSE, HAVE CREDIBILITY WITH THE GOVERNMENT?\n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] ALLOW ME TO RESERVE THE IDENTITY OF THE SOURCE, BUT HE DOES\nHAVE MUCH CREDIBILITY.  HE IS SOMEONE WHO IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT\nMOVEMENT, AND HE DOES HAVE CREDIBILITY.  THE INTERESTING ASPECT OF THIS IS\nTHE WAY THIS BIG MANGY DOG, THIS MR VILLALOBOS, THINKS.  IF HE WANTS TO COME\nHERE AND PARTICIPATE, WE'LL TAKE HIS WORD, AND LET US SEE IF HE WILL REALLY\nHAVE A LANDSLIDE VICTORY.\n\n   [REPORTER] WOULD THERE BE ANY GUARANTEES FOR HIS PARTICIPATION?\n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] DIDN'T I JUST TELL YOU THAT THE FIRST MANGY DOGS,\nUNGO AND ZAMORA, ARE ALREADY HERE?  WE DO HAVE THE BEST OF INTENTIONS; THERE\nIS A WILLINGNESS TO DO THIS.  NOW, IF THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO DO IT, THAT IS A\nDIFFERENT STORY.  I AM JUST TELLING YOU ABOUT THE FIRST INDICATIONS WE HAVE\nHAD, IN ADDITION TO SOME NOTES ON THE ELECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT BY SOME\nWHO CLAIM TO BE COMMANDERS.  THE OVERALL PICTURE HAS CHANGED SOMEWHAT IN THE\nLAST FEW YEARS.\n\n   [REPORTER] WHAT IS THAT CHANGE, MAJOR?  \n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] IN PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE NOTES THEY [THE FMLN\nCOMMANDERS] HAVE SENT, INCLUDING THE ONES SENT PRIOR TO THE ELECTIONS,\nTHEY SAID THAT IF THE ELECTIONS WERE POSTPONED THEY WOULD PARTICIPATE.\nTHAT IS AN INDICATION THAT THEY DO HAVE PLANS TO JOIN THE PROCESS.\n\n   [REPORTER] WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, MAJOR?   \n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] IT MEANS TWO BASIC THINGS:  ONE, THEY ARE LOST.  THE OPTION\nTO SEIZE POWER THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS NO LONGER EXISTS.  \n\n   [REPORTER] IN OTHER WORDS, THEY ARE LOST IN THE MILITARY FIELD?  \n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] THEY ARE LOST BOTH IN THE MILITARY FIELD AND IN\nTHE OPTION TO SEIZE POWER THROUGH VIOLENT MEANS.  SECOND, THEY NO LONGER\nHAVE THE SUPPORT, AND WE HAVE BEEN ANALYZING THAT FOR SOME TIME NOW.  THERE\nIS NO LONGER ANY SUPPORT FOR THIS TYPE OF REBEL MOVEMENT, FOR THIS TYPE OF\nARMED REBEL MOVEMENT TO SEIZE POWER.\n\n   [REPORTER] YOU MEAN SUPPORT FROM THE USSR?  \n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] THERE IS NO SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNIST WORLD IN\nGENERAL.  NATURALLY, THIS IS BASED VERY MUCH ON THE SO-CALLED PERESTROYKA.\nTHEREFORE, THEY WILL HAVE TO JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, BECAUSE OTHERWISE\nTHEY ARE GOING TO BE LEFT OUT.  IF THEY WANT TO CONTINUE SHOOTING BULLETS\nJUST FOR THE SAKE OF SHOOTING, THEY ARE GOING TO BE LEFT OUT OF EVERYTHING\nAND EVERYONE.\n\n   [REPORTER] THERE IS MUCH TALK HERE ABOUT FORMING AN INTERNAL OPPOSITION\nFRONT; I BELIEVE THIS IS PART OF THE \"EVERYONE AGAINST ARENA\" CAMPAIGN.  DO\nYOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS AND THE LINE THIS INTERNAL FRONT MIGHT\nFOLLOW?\n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] WELL, NOT EXACTLY.  HOWEVER, IT IS LOGICAL THAT AN INTERNAL\nPOLITICAL FRONT COULD BE FORMED.  THAT WOULD BE A POLITICAL PROCESS WITHIN A\nDEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  IT IS ALL RIGHT TO DO THAT.  THEY HAVE ALL THE RIGHT IN\nTHE WORLD TO DO THAT.\n\n   NOW, THERE ARE SUBVERSIVE THOUGHTS.  WE ARE REFERRING TO THOSE BIG MANGY\nDOGS WHO WANT TO TAKE THE FIRST STEPS IN JOINING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.  ON\nTHE OTHER HAND, THEY ARE SUBVERSIVE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DISRUPTING PUBLIC\nORDER.  IF WHAT THEY WANT IS TO CAUSE HARM AND HINDER THE PROGRAMS PREPARED\nBY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIS CABINET, THEY ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT\nANYHOW.\n\n   REMEMBER THAT VERY SIMPLE PHRASE I TOLD YOU AT THE BEGINNING.  THEY\nCLAIM THAT IF ARENA FAILS, THEY ARE THE ALTERNATIVE.  THAT IS WHAT THE\nGROUP OF UNGO, ZAMORA, AND ALL THOSE REALLY THINKS.  THERE IS ANOTHER\nGREAT POSSIBILITY, AND THAT IS WHAT IS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN HERE:\nARENA WILL NOT FAIL.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL NOT FAIL.  HOWEVER,\nTHEY ARE GOING TO TRY ALL THE ILLEGAL, SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS THEY CAN TO\nMAKE US FAIL.  [CONTINUED]",

THIS\nWAS BECAUSE THE COMMUNISTS KNOW THAT THE RURAL AREAS HAVE REACTED\nFAVORABLY.  THEY HAVE ALREADY REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT WE ARE GOING\nTO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGRARIAN REFORM, WHICH\nSHOULD BE PERMANENT.  THE AGRARIAN REFORM PROCESS CAN BE MADE IN\nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS AND THE CONSTITUTION WITHOUT RESORTING TO\nVIOLENCE.  THE AGRARIAN REFORM CAN BE PRODUCTIVE, AND THAT IS OUR\nGOAL.  THE AGRARIAN REFORM IN OUR COUNTRY WILL BE MADE PRODUCTIVE.\n\n   [REPORTER] THERE WERE REPORTS THAT PEASANTS WERE CONCERNED BECAUSE SIX\nCASES HAD BEEN DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THE LANDOWNERS AND THE LANDS WERE LEGALLY\nTURNED OVER TO THE OWNERS.\n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] I DO NOT KNOW IF THERE WERE SIX OR MORE CASES.  IF WE LOOK\nAT IT FROM THE LEGAL POINT OF VIEW, SERIOUS MISTAKES WERE MADE WHEN THE\nLANDS WERE VIOLENTLY OCCUPIED.  MANY LANDS WERE IMPROPERLY OCCUPIED.  WE\nHAVE TO LOOK AT THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THIS.  WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS\nFOR THESE PEOPLE.  IF THEY CANNOT STAY ON THOSE LANDS, THEY CAN TAKE OTHER\nLANDS, BECAUSE THERE ARE ABOUT 33 LAND TRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY\nABANDONED.  REFUGEES AND ARMY FAMILIES MAY BE BROUGHT TO THOSE REGIONS.\nEVEN THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH OUR AGRARIAN REFORM PLAN CAN GO THERE.  NO ONE\nWILL BE ABANDONED.\n\n   [REPORTER] WHERE ARE THOSE 33 LAND TRACTS?  \n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.\n\n   [REPORTER] IN GENERAL TERMS, AND TO END THIS INTERVIEW, DO YOU BELIEVE\nTHIS 5-YEAR PERIOD WILL BE ONE OF PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT IN EL SALVADOR?  \n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] YES, AND WE ARE SURE THAT WE WILL WIN THE ELECTIONS IN THE\nFIRST ROUND IN 1994.  IN THIS 5-YEAR PERIOD WE WILL ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF\nHAVING AN HONEST GOVERNMENT AND OF BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS OURSELVES\nDEMOCRATICALLY.  THERE WILL BE PRODUCTIVITY AND THE PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR\nWILL ONCE AGAIN FEEL PROUD OF BEING SALVADORANS.  WE WILL NO LONGER NEED\nOTHERS TO DONATE THINGS TO US BECAUSE WE CAN PRODUCE THEM HERE.  WE WILL\nCONTINUE WORKING TO RESCUE THIS SHIP SO THAT IT CAN SAIL EFFICIENTLY.\n\n   [REPORTER] MAJOR, WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR VISITING US TODAY AND FOR\nDISCUSSING ALL OF THE ISSUES WE COVERED.  IT HAS BEEN INTERESTING TO LISTEN\nTO YOUR POINTS OF VIEW AND THOSE OF YOUR PARTY REGARDING THE VARIOUS ISSUES.\n\n   [D'AUBUISSON] THANK YOU.  THIS HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING INTERVIEW.  I WILL\nALWAYS BE WILLING TO COME BACK HERE AND TALK TO YOU AGAIN.  \n\n   [REPORTER] THANK YOU, MAJOR, AND WE THANK ALL OUR VIEWERS. ",

THESE NEWSMEN WERE\nFORCED TO RESIGN THEIR JOBS, BUT OTHER REPORTERS, WHO ALSO RECEIVED\nTHREATENING TELEPHONE CALLS, DID NOT.\n\n   THE FORMER REPORTERS INDICATED THAT THIS IS YET ANOTHER ATTACK ON FREEDOM\nOF INFORMATION AND THOUGHT SINCE 1 AUGUST, WHEN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT IDEOLOGUE\nDANILO BARILLAS, WHO WROTE COLUMNS FOR THE MAGAZINE, WAS MURDERED.  \n\n   A FEW DAYS AFTER BARRILLA'S MURDER, ROLANDO PINEDA LAM, POR QUE MAGAZINE\nPUBLISHER AND SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE CREATION OF THE\nPOPULAR ALLIANCE PARTY-5, FOUNDED BY DANILO BARILLAS UNDER THE NAME FCD-5\n[CIVIC DEMOCRATIC FRONT], HAD TO GO INTO EXILE.\n\n   WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE MAGAZINE POR QUE BELONGS TO THE TALENTO\nEMPRESARIAL COMPANY, IS EDITED BY ASOCIACION LIBRO EXITO, INC, AND APPEARS\nEVERY TUESDAY.\n\n   THE EDITORIAL HOUSE DECIDED TO SUSPEND PUBLICATION BECAUSE OF THE DEATH\nTHREATS. SO, IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT THIS NEWS MEDIUM WILL DIE A FEW MONTHS\nAFTER IT BEGAN.\n\n   ACTS OF INTIMIDATION AGAINST THE PRODUCTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF OF\nTHE AFOREMENTIONED MAGAZINE OCCUR ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH CHARGES BY THE\nGUATEMALAN CHAMBER OF JOURNALISM THAT THE COUNTRY'S INDEPENDENT PRESS IS\nBEING HARASSED.

HOUSES, FARMS, DISCOTHEQUES, AND APARTMENTS REPORTEDLY\nOWNED BY PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA HAVE BEEN SEIZED BY THE AUTHORITIES;\n921 PERSONS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED, 2 OF WHOM FACE CHARGES THAT MERIT\nTHEIR EXTRADITION.\n\n   THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN\nANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT.  HOURS AFTER LEARNING ABOUT THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY\nTHE GOVERNMENT TO COUNTER DRUG TRAFFICKERS, REGIONAL AUTHORITIES LAUNCHED A\nLARGE-SCALE PLAN TO CARRY OUT RAIDS AND CONFISCATIONS, AND TO SET UP ROAD\nBLOCKS.\n\n   TWENTY-TWO PROPERTIES -- INCLUDING FARMS, DISCOTHEQUES, BUILDINGS, AND\nRESTAURANTS -- WERE SEIZED UNDER THE CHARGES THAT THEY WERE OWNED BY MEMBERS\nOF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.  THE MOST OUTSTANDING CASES INCLUDE THE MONACO\nBUILDING -- WHICH WAS ALMOST DESTROYED DURING A DYNAMITE ATTACK LAST YEAR,\nWAS BEING REPAIRED, AND HAD PRACTICALLY BEEN RESTORED TO ITS FORMER SPLENDOR\n-- GAMA BUILDING, INTERNATIONAL DISCOTHEQUE, CAMA SUELTA DISCOTHEQUE\nFORTALEZA DEL LAURO DISCOTHEQUE, AND DON MATEO DISCOTHEQUE, UNDOUBTEDLY THE\nMOST LUXURIOUS IN THE CITY.\n\n   SEVERAL FARMS WERE ALSO SEIZED, INCLUDING EL BIZCOCHO FARM, WHERE SEVERAL\nWEAPONS CACHES WERE FOUND, AND LAS AGUILAS FARM, BECAUSE THE VALUE OF ITS\nFURNITURE AND APPLIANCES SURPASS 3 BILLION PESOS.  THE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC\nIN ALL THE CONFISCATED PROPERTIES IS THEIR LUXURY AND ECCENTRICISM, THUS\nMAKING THEIR TOTAL VALUE INCALCULABLE.\n\n   THE AUTHORITIES ALSO SEIZED WEAPONS, VEHICLES, AND COMMUNICATIONS\nEQUIPMENT.  THE FIRST REPORT INDICATES 921 PERSONS WERE ARRESTED BUT THE\nFIGURE COULD BE HIGHER, GIVEN THE OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT IN RECENT HOURS.\nTHE ARRESTED PERSONS INCLUDE TWO WHO REPORTEDLY FACE ENOUGH CHARGES TO\nGUARANTEE THEIR EXTRADITION.\n\n   MEANWHILE, ANOTHER PERSON HAS BEEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH\nINTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING OPERATIONS.  SHE IS ANA ELENA BEATRIZ\nRODRIGUEZ, WHO IS THE THIRD EXTRADITABLE PERSON SOUGHT BY U.S.  AUTHORITIES\nIN CONNECTION WITH MONEY LAUNDERING.  SHE WAS CAPTURED IN CARTAGENA.\n\n   THE COLOMBIAN ARMY'S RAIDS ON PROPERTIES REPORTEDLY OWNED BY DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS STILL CONTINUE.  TWO NEW FARMS LOCATED WITHIN THE MOUNTAIN RANGE\nIN PALMIRA MUNICIPALITY JURISDICTION WERE RECENTLY SEIZED BY THE ARMED\nFORCES.  LA RUIZA FARM, A SYNONYM FOR OSTENTATION AND LUXURY, IS A\nRECREATION CENTER OWNED, ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, BY RAMIRO CORREA.\nPEOPLE VISITING THE FARM COULD ENJOY THE POOLS, SURROUNDED BY LUXURY RUGS,\nJACUZZIS, A TENNIS COURT, BARS, EXOTICALLY DECORATED BEDROOMS, AND A\nFOUNTAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LIVING ROOM.\n\n   THE AUTHORITIES SEIZED A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF WEAPONS, COMMUNICATION\nEQUIPMENT, BULLET-PROOF VESTS, AMMUNITION FOR RIFLES, GRENADES BROUGHT FROM\nISRAEL, MILITARY UNIFORMS, AND INFRA-RED SIGHTS -- WHICH NOT EVEN THE ARMY\nHAS -- AT EL ROSAL FARM, LOCATED\n IN THE AREA OF POTRERILLOS.  THE AUTHORITIES ALSO SEIZED MOTORCYCLES\nSMUGGLED INTO THE COUNTRY.  MOST OF THE VALLEY WAS VISIBLE FROM A LOOKOUT\nTOWER, PROBABLY FOR SECURITY REASONS OR FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES.  THE\nMAIN ATTRACTION AT THE FARM WERE TRAINED HIGH- STEPPING COLOMBIAN HORSES.\nTHE OWNERS OF THESE FARMS HAVE YET TO BE ARRESTED, AND THERE IS STILL NO\nINFORMATION ON THEIR WHEREABOUTS.  THE VALUE OF THESE PROPERTIES IS\nCALCULATED IN MORE THAN 100 BILLION PESOS.\n\n   THE AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO DEAL BLOWS TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN\nATLANTICO DEPARTMENT.  BERNARDO LONDONO QUINTERO, A NATIVE OF PEREIRA AND\nACCUSED OF BEING A MEMBER OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS CAPTURED EARLY THIS\nMORNING NORTH OF BARRANQUILLA.  THE AUTHORITIES ARE CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING\nLONDONO'S ACTIVITIES BECAUSE HE IS APPARENTLY SOUGHT BY THE U.S.\nAUTHORITIES.  FURTHERMORE, THE BARRANQUILLA AUTHORITIES HAVE ARRESTED\nALBERTO ORLANDES GAMBOA, A 34-YEAR-OLD NATIVE OF BARRANQUILLA WHO IS\nCONSIDERED ANOTHER EXTRADITABLE PERSON. THE AUTHORITIES CONFISCATED HIS\nWINE-COLORED TOYOTA LAND CUISER AND A BROWNING 9-MM PISTOL.S EVERAL RAIDS ARE\nCURRENTLY UNDER WAY IN NORTHERN BARRANQUILLA AT RESIDENCES PRESUMABLY OWNED\nBY DRUG TRAFFICKERS.",

WE HAVE BEEN ASKING THE GOVERNMENT FOR PEACE SINCE THE TALKS IN\nPANAMA IN 1984.  A LOT OF VIOLENCE COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED.\n\n   2. WE ACCEPTED THE PEACE PLAN PROPOSED BY PRESIDENT BARCO BUT WE RECEIVED\nNO REPLY FROM THE GOVERNMENT.\n\n   3.  THE ONLY REPLY WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN\nREPRESSION, ARBITRARY [WORDS INDISTINCT] UNJUST ARREST OF OUR RELATIVES,\nLOOTING OF OUR HOUSES.\n\n   4.  ALL KINDS OF JURIDICAL VIOLATIONS HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED AGAINST US.\n\n   5.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS BRIBED JUSTICE WITH [WORDS INDISTINCT], DIPLOMATIC\nSINECURES, AND TRIPS ABROAD.\n\n   6.  THE ACTIONS OF CONFISCATION ARE NOTHING NEW; THEY HAVE ALWAYS\nPREVAILED IN OUR COUNTRY.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] WERE UNJUSTLY ARRESTED AND\nIMPRISONED, EVEN THOUGH NO ARREST WARRANTS HAD BEEN ISSUED AGAINST THEM, AND\nMANY OF OUR PROPERTIES AND POSSESSIONS WERE ARBITRARILY CONFISCATED OR\nUSURPED.\n\n   7.  COLOMBIAN CITIZENS CHARGED WITH MONEY LAUNDERING HAVE BEEN EXTRADITED\nAND WILL BE EXTRADITED, ALTHOUGH THIS REPRESENTS A VIOLATION OF COLOMBIAN\nLAWS.  \n\n   8.

WE DECLARE A WIDESPREAD AND TOTAL WAR ON THE GOVERNMENT, THE\nINDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL OLIGARCHY, THE JOURNALISTS WHO HAVE ATTACKED AND\nMISTREATED US, JUDGES WHO HAVE BEEN BRIBED BY THE GOVERNMENT, THE\nEXTRADITING MAGISTRATES, THE BUSINESS ORGANIZATION PRESIDENTS, AND ALL THOSE\nWHO HAVE PERSECUTED US IN THE PAST.\n\n   10.  WE WILL NOT RESPECT THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO HAVE NOT RESPECTED OUR\nFAMILIES. WE WILL KILL THEM, AND WE WILL BURN AND DESTROY THE OLIGARCHY'S\nINDUSTRIES, PROPERTIES, AND MANSIONS.\n\n   (SIGNED) THE EXTRADITABLES.",

ALL CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO PLACE THEMSELVES IN THE HANDS OF\nTHEIR GUARDIAN ANGELS, IN OTHER WORDS TO THEIR CHIEF ESCORT.  THE\nCHIEF ESCORT AND THE CANDIDATE WILL JOINTLY PLAN EACH TOUR AND WILL\nPROGRAM ALL MOVEMENTS IN DETAIL AND FOLLOW THE PROGRAM TO THE LETTER.\n\n   THE CANDIDATE MUST INFORM THE CHIEF ESCORT OF HIS AGENDA AND OF ANY\nTHREAT OR INDICATION OF DANGER HE RECEIVES.  THE CANDIDATE MUST USE HIS\nESCORTS EXCLUSIVELY FOR HIS PROTECTION AND FOR NO OTHER USE.\n\n   2. A CANDIDATE'S ESCORTS MUST KNOW THE CANDIDATE'S BLOODTYPE, HIS\nILLNESSES, AND WHICH MEDICINE HE TAKES.  THE ESCORTS MUST ALSO KNOW THE\nNAMES OF THE CANDIDATE'S CLOSEST FRIENDS.\n\n   3. THE CANDIDATE MUST LEARN WHAT TO DO IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.  HIS\nESCORTS WILL TEACH HIM WHAT TO DO.\n\n   4. NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED IF THE CANDIDATES CHANGE THEIR PLANS AT THE\nLAST MINUTE.  THE CANDIDATE MUST NOT FALL INTO A ROUTINE.  HE MUST CHANGE\nROUTES, SCHEDULES, AND PROGRAMS ALWAYS IN CONSULTATION WITH HIS CHIEF ESCORT.\n\n   5. THE CANDIDATE MUST ALWAYS HAVE A DOCTOR IN HIS GROUP.  \n\n   6. EACH CANDIDATE WILL HAVE TO BEAR AN EXTRA BURDEN.  HE WILL HAVE\nTO WEAR A HEAVY AND SUFFOCATING BULLET-PROOF VEST.  SUPPORTERS, PLEASE\nTAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT.\n\n   7. A PUBLIC RALLY IN AN OPEN PLACE AT NIGHT CAN BE DEADLY FOR YOUR\nCANDIDATE.  PLEASE EXCLUDE ANY SUCH RALLIES FROM YOUR PLANS.\n\n   8. SAY NO TO THE USE OF FIRECRACKERS AND POWDER KEGS DURING\nDEMONSTRATIONS.  SUCH THINGS CONFUSE ESCORTS AND SECURITY CORPS.\n\n   9. SUPPORTERS, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT CROWDS WHO WANT TO SHAKE\nCANDIDATES' HANDS OR TOUCH THEM CAN BE DEADLY.  ESCORTS SHOULD NOT ALLOW\nSUCH THINGS.\n\n   10. CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO LIMIT THEIR WALKS IN PUBLIC PLACES AND REDUCE\nTHEIR SOCIAL ACTIVITIES TO THE MINIMUM.  CANDIDATES WILL VISIT THEIR FRIENDS\nAT UNUSUAL HOURS.\n\n   THIS IS HOW SECURITY WILL BE HANDLED FROM NOW ON.  ALL THESE MEASURES\nHAVE TURNED CANDIDATES INTO MEN WITH LIMITATIONS.  THEIR SUPPORTERS MUST\nUNDERSTAND THEIR CANDIDATES' SITUATION.  CANDIDATES ARE MEN UNDER THE\nDICTATORSHIP OF THEIR GUARDIAN ANGELS WHO LOOK AFTER THEIR SAFETY IN TIMES\nOF RAGE.",

      "text": "   NO CITY (ISRAEL), 25 AUG 89 -- [INTERVIEW WITH NETANYAHU BY\nFRIEDMAN AND DAN] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] [FRIEDMAN] YOU MUST KNOW BETTER\nTHAN I THAT THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT ITSELF, AND NOT ONLY INDIVIDUAL\nISRAELI NATIONALS, ARE ACCUSED OF MAKING SECURITY-RELATED DEALS WITH\nVARIOUS REGIMES WHICH -- TO THE CIVILIZED WESTERN WORLD, AT LEAST --\nAPPEAR TO BE OF QUESTIONABLE REPUTE.  WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA THAT GUIDE\nISRAEL'S ACTIONS AS A STATE AND WHEN ISSUING PERMITS TO PRIVATE\nCOMPANIES TO MAKE DEALS WITH SUCH COUNTRIES?\n\n   [NETANYAHU] I WILL NOT GO INTO THE DETAILS OF THE VARIOUS CRITERIA\nDETERMINED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, WHICH ARE OFTEN RELATED TO OUR OWN\nDEFENSE ISSUES.  ONE CRITERION, HOWEVER, IS CLEAR:  WE DO NOT ALLOW\nCOOPERATION WITH ELEMENTS WHICH ARE NOT STATE-AFFILIATED, SUCH AS CARTELS,\nGROUPS, OR GANGS.  ALL THESE ARE OFF LIMITS.  THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT\nTHAT, AND NO GREY AREAS.  THEREFORE, IF THE REPORTS FROM COLOMBIA ARE TRUE,\nTHE PEOPLE ACTED COUNTER TO OUR POLICY AND IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW.\n\n   [FRIEDMAN] WHAT ABOUT WORKING WITH OPPOSITION MOVEMENTS TO CERTAIN\nREGIMES?\n\n   [NETANYAHU] I REPEAT:  STATE MOVEMENTS ONLY, OR, LET US SAY, STATE\nREGIMES.  THIS IS OUR POLICY.  ANY OTHER ACTION RUNS COUNTER TO OUR POLICY.\n\n   [DAN] WHEN ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG TRAFFICKING IN COLOMBIA IS\nMENTIONED, DO YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF ISRAELIS REFERRED TO?  PERHAPS THE\nSTATEMENT IS EXAGGERATED, AND THERE ARE NO MORE THAN ONE OR TWO, PERHAPS\nTHREE ISRAELIS?\n\n   [NETANYAHU] THAT IS A GOOD POINT; REPORTS ARE SO OFTEN BLOWN OUT OF\nPROPORTION.  WE SEEM TO HAVE SOME KIND OF REPUTATION WHICH OFTEN LEADS TO\nEXAGGERATED AND FANTASTIC -- I DO NOT WISH TO USE THE TERM ROMANTIC --\nREPORTS IN THIS CONTEXT.  IN ANY EVENT, THERE ARE MANY REPORTS, AND WE WOULD\nLIKE TO GET TO THE CORE OF TRUTH BEHIND THEM.  AFTER THAT, WE WILL DECIDE\nWHAT ACTION WE CAN TAKE.  WE MAY TAKE LEGAL STEPS, TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S\nPASSPORTS, AND RESORT TO OTHER METHODS.\n\n   [FRIEDMAN] IN THE PAST, MR NETANYAHU, YOU BELONGED TO AN ARMY UNIT IN\nWHICH OUR FINEST YOUNG PEOPLE SERVED.  HAVE YOU FOUND FORMER ARMY FRIENDS IN\nANY OF THE MENTIONED NAMES?\n\n   [NETANYAHU] NO, AND I HOPE NEVER TO FIND ANY.  \n\n   [DAN] DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE PHENOMENON?  \n\n   [NETANYAHU] IF IT EXISTS! \n\n   [FRIEDMAN] YES, IF IT EXISTS.  OUR ENTIRE CONVERSATION IS\nSUBJECT TO THIS PROVISO, BECAUSE WE HAVE NO SOLID GROUNDS FOR DISCUSSION.\n\n   [NETANYAHU] IF IT EXISTS, I THINK IT REFLECTS THE MORAL CORRUPTION OF A\nFEW INDIVIDUALS.  THE STATE CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT EACH OF ITS\nNATIONALS DOES OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.  THESE PEOPLE MAY HAVE SUCCUMBED TO\nMERCENARY OR OTHER TEMPTATIONS.  THE EXPRESSION OF SELLING ONE'S SOUL TO THE\nDEVIL IS APPROPRIATE IN THEIR CASE.\n\n   [FRIEDMAN] DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER BINYAMIN NETANYAHU, THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH.  \n\n   [NETANYAHU] THANK YOU.  ",

      "text": "   BOGOTA, 25 AUG 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [TEXT] LAST\nMINUTE REPORT: IN CONFUSING EVENTS, POLICE LIEUTENANT ALFREDO CORREA\nAND ONE PRIVATE WERE KILLED IN VALLE DEPARTMENT.  NO FURTHER\nINFORMATION ON THIS INCIDENT HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE, OTHER THAN THAT\nAUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING THE EVENT.\n\n   IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT 10TH ARMY BRIGADE MEMBERS FOUND AND\nCONFISCATED 2 METRIC TONS OF HIGH-GRADE COCAINE AT LA MONEDA FARM IN LECHI,\nCAUCASIA, AT THE BORDER BETWEEN ANTIOQUIA AND CORDOBA DEPARTMENTS.  THE DRUG\nWAS FOUND IN SEALED WATERPROOF PACKAGES IN UNDERGROUND TUNNELS. THIS MAKES\nAUTHORITIES BELIEVE THE DRUG WAS READY TO BE AIR DROPPED OVER THE SEA TO BE\nPICKED UP BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS. IN ADDITION, A LARGE NUMBER OF ARMS, A\nSIZABLE AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION, AS WELL AS AUTOMOBILES AND RADIO SETS WERE\nCONFISCATED.  THE DRUG WAS SET ON FIRE IN THE PRESENCE OF JUDGES AND\nMILITARY AUTHORITIES.  A CLANDESTINE LANDING STRIP WAS ALSO DESTROYED.\n\n   ARSON SEEMS TO BE THE NEW CRIMINAL STYLE USED IN ANTIOQUIA.  IN LESS THAN\n24 HOURS, FOUR FARMS HAVE BEEN SET ON FIRE.  THREE OF THESE FARMS, LOCATED\nNEAR MEDELLIN, ARE OWNED BY POLITICAL AND INDUSTRIAL LEADERS EDGAR GUTIERREZ\nCASTRO, IGNACIO VELEZ ESCOBAR, AND AUGUSTO LOPEZ.  THE MOST RECENT OF THESE\nINCIDENTS OCCURRED AT THE LLANO GRANDE COUNTRY CLUB EARLY THIS MORNING.\nSEVERAL ARMED MEN SHOWED UP AT THE SITE AND SET THE CLUB ON FIRE AFTER\nTHREATENING AND BEATING UP THE WATCHMEN.  THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSSES HAS NOT\nYET BEEN DETERMINED.  THE MANAGER DID NOT ALLOW REPORTERS INTO THE PLACE.  IT\nWAS REPORTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE ATTACKERS IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS\nEXTRADITABLES WHO SAID THE ACTION WAS BEING TAKEN IN REPRISAL FOR THE\nGOVERNMENT ACTIONS AGAINST THEM.  THE ARMED MEN LEFT THE PLACE SHOUTING THAT\nTHEIR REACTION HAS JUST BEGUN AND THAT THEIR STRUGGLE WILL CONTINUE.\nFURTHER DAMAGE TO THE CLUB AND THE LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE WERE PREVENTED BY\nWORKERS WHO REACTED PROMPTLY.\n\n   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN MEASURES TO COUNTERACT THESE ACTIONS.\nTHE ARMY THIS AFTERNOON WILL RECEIVE THE INITIAL U.S.  TACTICAL SUPPORT AS\nPART OF THE NEW ANTITERRORIST OFFENSIVE, GOVERNMENT SOURCES HAVE REPORTED.\nU.S. MILITARY CARGO PLANES WILL FLY TO COLOMBIA ARMED TWIN-TURBINE BELL-212\nHELICOPTERS.  IN ADDITION, THE PENTAGON WILL SHIP RADIO COMMUNICATIONS\nEQUIPMENT.  THE HELICOPTERS WILL BE FLOWN BY COLOMBIAN MILITARY CREWS, U.S.\nSTATE DEPARTMENT SOURCES SAID IN WASHINGTON.  FOR THE TIME BEING, BOTH\nGEORGE BUSH'S ADMINISTRATION AND VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT ARE NOT\nCONSIDERING THE PRESENCE OF U.S. MILITARY MEN IN COLOMBIA.  \n\n   OVER THE PAST 72 HOURS, THE ARMY RAIDED FIVE FARMS, ONE HOME, AND A\nBAR-RESTAURANT OWNED BY GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, CAMILO ZAPATA, AND PABLO\nESCOBAR GAVIRIA.  THE RAIDS WERE CONDUCTED BY 13TH BRIGADE TROOPS IN CHIA,\nPACHO, AND BOGOTA.  THIS FARM, KNOWN AS EL CASTILLO DE MARROQUIN, OWNED BY\nZAPATA AND ESTIMATED TO BE WORTH MORE THAN 100 BILLION PESOS, WAS RAIDED ON\nWEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.  ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, THIS VERITABLE FORTRESS,\nLOCATED ON THE EL COMUN BRIDGE, WAS MANAGED BY RETIRED POLICE MAJOR ALVARO\nTOVAR TOVAR.  LUXURIOUS CARS, A GOLD-ORNAMENTED CHAPEL, A SWIMMING POOL\nFITTED WITH A HEATING SYSTEM, 15 STABLES WITH FINE HORSES, A TENNIS COURT,\nAND THE IMPRESSIVE CASTLE ALL MAKE UP A FARM WORTH MILLIONS.  EXTENSIVE\nGARDENS, LONG TRAILS, AND AN ATTRACTIVE LAKE COMPLEMENT THE WONDERFUL NATURAL\nLANDSCAPE OF THE REAL ESTATE RIGHT BY THE BOGOTA NORTHERN FREEWAY.  THERE\nARE EXOTIC ADORNMENTS ON THE WALLS.  FOR INSTANCE, THERE IS A BOTERO\nPAINTING WORTH 4 MILLION PESOS.  IN ONE ROOM, THERE WERE MANY ELECTRIC\nAPPLIANCES AND A FULL RADIO COMMUNICATIONS SET.  THE EXORBITANT WEALTH IS\nINDICATED BY EVEN A WITCHCRAFT ROOM.  [CONTINUED]",

WE APPLAUD THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT FOR THE BOLD\nSTEPS HE IS TAKING, BUT WE MUST SHOW THE CARTELS THAT HE IS NOT\nALONE,\" BAHAMAS' FOREIGN MINISTER CHARLES CARTER SAID.\n\n   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED UP THE FIGHT AGAINST THE TRAFFICKERS\nFOLLOWING THE KILLING OF A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. CARTER SAID THAT \"ALL OF\nUS IN THIS HEMISPHERE\" MUST SHOW THE DRUG DEALERS THEY ARE \"PART OF THE WAR\".\n\n   THE BAHAMAS WANTS TO HOST A MEETING THIS YEAR OF LEADERS OF THE\nHEMISPHERE TO DEFINE A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR WAGING AN ALL OUT WAR ON\nTHE PRODUCTION, PROCESSING, SHIPMENT, DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS.\nCARTER TOLD CANA THAT RECENT EVENTS IN COLOMBIA DEMONSTRATED THE NEED FOR A\nWELL PLANNED, COORDINATED AND IMPLEMENTED PROGRAM WHICH WOULD TACKLE ALL\nASPECTS OF THE DRUG PROBLEM. HE SAID HIS COUNTRY HOPED SUCH A SUMMIT COULD\nBE HELD BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR.\n\n   THE FOREIGN MINISTER TOLD CANA THAT HIS COUNTRY HAD INDICATED TO THE\nUNITED STATES IN JANUARY A WILLINGNESS TO HOST THE SUMMIT BUT, TO DATE,\nTHERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION.  \"WE DISCUSSED\nTHE IDEA OF THE SUMMIT AT THE CARICOM (CARIBBEAN COMMUNITY) FOREIGN\nMINISTERS MEETING, THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING, AT THE ORGANIZATION OF\nAMERICAN STATES (OAS) AND WE INFORMED THE UNITED STATES BY DIPLOMATIC NOTE\nIN JANUARY OF OUR DESIRE TO HOST THE MEETING BUT SO FAR THE UNITED STATES\nHAS NOT RESPONDED. WHETHER WE WOULD ULTIMATELY GO AHEAD WITH IT I'M NOT\nSURE,\" CARTER EXPLAINED.\n\n   CARTER WAS AGAINST USING UNITED STATES TROOPS IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE\nCARIBBEAN IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS, POINT OUT THAT \"THE DEMOCRATIC\nTRADITIONS IN SOME OF OUR COUNTRIES WOULD BE THREATENED IF WE WERE TO RESORT\nTO THE USE OF FORCE.\" HE SAID ARRANGEMENTS SUCH AS ONE BETWEEN HIS COUNTRY\nAND THE UNITED STATES FOR JOINT POLICING COULD EXTENDED TO INVOLVE OTHER\nCOUNTRIES IN THE HEMISPHERE.\n\n   THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT THREE QUARTERS OF THE DRUGS PRODUCED ARE\nCONSUMED IN NORTH AMERICA. \"WE ARE NOT THE MARKETS.  COUNTRIES LIKE THE\nBAHAMAS, JAMAICA, TRINIDAD, CUBA AND BARBADOS ARE ONLY USED BY THE DRUG\nLORDS TO REACH THE 3 BILLION DOLLAR UNITED STATES MARKET,\" HE REMARKED. \"WE\nAREN'T REALLY THE TARGET AND THEREFORE WE MUST FOCUS ON THE QUESTION OF\nDEMAND. AND WE IN CARICOM, AND SPECIFICALLY IN THE BAHAMAS, ARE READY TO BE\nPART OF THE SOLUTION TO THE UNITED STATES DRUG PROBLEM.\"\n\n   CARTER SAID AMONG THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A SUMMIT WOULD BE \"A JUDICIAL\nATMOSPHERE\" THAT WOULD LET THE DRUG BARONS, DEALERS AND USERS \"KNOW THAT\nTHEY ARE CRIMINALS WHEREVER THEY ARE OR WHEREVER THEY GO.\"   ",

      "text": "   HAVANA (CUBA), 22 AUG 89 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [COMMENTARY]\n[MANOLO ORTEGA] [TEXT] THE FULL SCOPE OF THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE AND\nDEATH THAT HAS SWAMPED COLOMBIA OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IS NOW\nBEGINNING TO BE ASSESSED.  LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD\nHAVE REMAINED ON THE SIDELINES OF THAT SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRY'S\nDOMESTIC STRIFE, WHERE HUMAN LIFE IS ALMOST WORTHLESS.  VENEZUELAN\nPRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WHEN HE TOLD\nCOLOMBIAN RADIO CARACOL THAT WE MAY NOT BE DOING WHAT WE MUST\nCONCERNING CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN COLOMBIA.  CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ IS\nCONCERNED THAT SOME NATIONS MAY BE GETTING USED TO LIVNG IN A CLIMATE\nOF COLLECTIVE INTIMIDATION.\n\n   DAILY EVENTS OCCUR IN COLOMBIA AMID A CLIMATE OF NATIONAL UNCERTAINTY.\nBANDS OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE BUILT AN EMPIRE OF DIRTY MONEY AND\nBLOODTHIRSTY MAFIAS IN DEATHLY COMPLICITY WITH THE MILITARY DEPLOYMENT OF\n140 PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  YEARS AGO, WHEN THESE GROUPS ANNOUNCED THEIR GUNS\nWERE AIMED AT PROGRESSIVE AND LEFTIST PERSONALITIES, THEY OPERATED WITH THE\nUNSPOKEN COMPLICITY OF MANY SECTORS, INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, FOR\nSOME TIME NOW, THE MURDER VICTIMS HAVE BEEN LEFTISTS, LIBERALS,\nCONSERVATIVES, AND EVEN POLITICALLY INDEPENDENT PERSONS WHO OPPOSE THE CHAOS\nCREATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS, LANDOWNERS, SOME OFFICERS, AND PARAMILITARY\nGROUPS.  LUIS CARLOS GALAN, 46, PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, LIBERAL SENATOR,\nLAWYER, AND NEWSMEN IS THE LATEST VICTIM OF THIS DEATHLY SPIRIAL.  HIS\nREMAINS [29-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION] LUIS CARLOS GALAN.  DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS HAVE SHOWN THEIR HIT LIST IS NEVERENDING.  THEY ALSO BRING TO\nTHE FORE THE POWER AND SCOPE OF THE DIRTY WAR THESE PEOPLE BEGAN IN THE\nCOUNTRY AMID THE GOVERNMENT'S INACTION.\n\n   MANY WONDER HOW THE PARAMILITARY TOP COMMAND CAN GO UNPUNISHED,\nCONSIDERING THAT ITS CHIEF LEADERS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, BECAUSE MORE OFTEN\nTHAN NOT THE KILLERS DO VERY LITTLE TO COVER THEIR TRACKS.  LOOKING AHEAD,\nTHE COLOMBIAN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT WILL CONCLUDE IN NEXT YEAR'S ELECTIONS\nHAS BEEN DEALT A HEAVY BLOW WITH GALAN'S MURDER.  THE REMAINING PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO CONDUCT THEIR POLITICAL CAMPAIGN SURROUNDED BY\nARMIES OF BODYGUARDS, AN ARRANGEMENT WIDELY USED IN COLOMBIA BY POLITICIANS,\nLABOR LEADERS, JUDGES, ARTISTS, AND MINOR OFFICIALS.  PERPLEXITY OVER WHAT\nHAPPENED IN COLOMBIA IS ONE OF THE INITIAL REACTIONS IN LATIN AMERICA.  LUIS\nCARLOS GALAN'S MURDER ALSO CALLS FOR CONDEMNATION.  PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE IT\nMAY HELP MAKE THE CONTINENT MEDITATE ON WHETHER OR NOT IT IS ADVISABLE TO BE\nINDIFFERENT TO THE COLLECTIVE INTIMIDATION THAT PREVAILS IN COLOMBIA.\n ",

      "text": "   CLANDESTINE, 27 AUG 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]\n[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] 1.\nON SUNDAY 20 AUGUST, EIGHT FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION\nFRONT] DISABLED WAR COMRADES OCCUPIED THE [SAN SALVADOR METROPOLITAN]\nCATHEDRAL, WHERE THEY REMAIN STILL TO PROTEST THE VIOLATIONS BY THE\nARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT OF INTERNATIONAL\nLAW AS WELL AS NON-COMPLIANCE TO THE COMMITMENTS MADE WHEN THE RELEASE\nAND EXCHANGE OF COLONEL [OMAR NAPOLEON] AVALOS WAS NEGOTIATED IN\nPANAMA [IN 1987].\n\n   2.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND GREETS THE DISABLED COMRADES AND\nCONGRATULATES THEM ON DEMANDING THAT THEY BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY\nAND OBTAIN ADEQUATE MEDICAL ATTENTION.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND ALSO CALLS\nON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO OFFER SOLIDARITY\nAND SUPPORT FOR THE JUST DEMANDS OF THE WAR DISABLED.  WE RECOGNIZE AND\nENCOURAGE THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE THAT MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS IS\nGIVING IN FINDING A JUST SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT\nHINDERING HIS WORK AS A MEDIATOR IN SOLVING THE CONFLICT.\n\n   3.  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, THE ARMED FORCES HAS ASSAULTED FMLN HOSPITALS,\nCAPTURED, TORTURED, AND MURDERED MEDICAL STAFF AND PATIENTS.  ALSO, THEY\nHAVE CAPTURED, TORTURED, AND MURDERED DISABLED PERSONS IN VARIOUS\nCIRCUMSTANCES.  THIS BEHAVIOR IS IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH THE FMLN'S STRICT\nRESPECT FOR THE HOSPITALS, MEDICAL STAFF, AS WELL AS THE ARMED FORCES'\nDISABLED AND WOUNDED PERSONNEL, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE VULNERABLE TARGETS OF OUR\nACTIONS.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND REITERATES THIS POLICY OF PRINCIPLES AND\nDEMANDS THE SAME BEHAVIOR FROM THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n   4.  FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION OF THE CATHEDRAL BY THE DISABLED, [PRESIDENT\nALFREDO] CRISTIANI IS TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE AN OBJECT OF\nNEGOTIATION, DEMANDING CERTAIN ACTIONS OF THE FMLN.  THIS ATTITUDE BY THE\nARENA GOVERNMENT MIGHT MAKE THE PROBLEM MORE COMPLEX AND MAKE US REVERT TO\nCIRCUMSTANCES WE HAD ALREADY SURPASSED.  THE DEPARTURE FROM THE COUNTRY OF\nTHE DISABLED IS A RIGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD RESPECT, AND THIS CANNOT\nBE CONSIDERED AN ISSUE THAT CAN BE USED FOR NEGOTIATIONS OR BLACKMAIL.\n\n   WE ARE SURE THAT THIS JUST DEMAND WHICH HAS LED THE DISABLED COMRADES TO\nSTAY AT THE CATHEDRAL UNTIL THEY AND THEIR COMRADES CAN LEAVE THE COUNTRY\nWILL BE SUPPORTED BY ALL OF OUR PEOPLE, WHILE INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WILL\nLEAVE IT CLEARLY ESTABLISHED THAT CRISTIANI, ARENA, AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE\nACTING IN AN UNJUST AND INCORRECT MANNER.  [SIGNED] FMLN GENERAL COMMAND, 26\nAUGUST 1989.  ",

      "text": "   CLANDESTINE, 27 AUG 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]\n[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT] 1.\nON SUNDAY 20 AUGUST, EIGHT FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION\nFRONT] DISABLED WAR COMRADES OCCUPIED THE [SAN SALVADOR METROPOLITAN]\nCATHEDRAL, WHERE THEY REMAIN STILL TO PROTEST THE VIOLATIONS BY THE\nARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] GOVERNMENT OF INTERNATIONAL\nLAW AS WELL AS NON-COMPLIANCE TO THE COMMITMENTS MADE WHEN THE RELEASE\nAND EXCHANGE OF COLONEL [OMAR NAPOLEON] AVALOS WAS NEGOTIATED IN\nPANAMA [IN 1987].\n\n   2.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND GREETS THE DISABLED COMRADES AND\nCONGRATULATES THEM ON DEMANDING THAT THEY BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY\nAND OBTAIN ADEQUATE MEDICAL ATTENTION.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND ALSO CALLS\nON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO OFFER SOLIDARITY\nAND SUPPORT FOR THE JUST DEMANDS OF THE WAR DISABLED.  WE RECOGNIZE AND\nENCOURAGE THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE THAT MSGR ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS IS\nGIVING IN FINDING A JUST SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT\nHINDERING HIS WORK AS A MEDIATOR IN SOLVING THE CONFLICT.\n\n   3.  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, THE ARMED FORCES HAS ASSAULTED FMLN HOSPITALS,\nCAPTURED, TORTURED, AND MURDERED MEDICAL STAFF AND PATIENTS.  ALSO, THEY\nHAVE CAPTURED, TORTURED, AND MURDERED DISABLED PERSONS IN VARIOUS\nCIRCUMSTANCES.  THIS BEHAVIOR IS IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH THE FMLN'S STRICT\nRESPECT FOR THE HOSPITALS, MEDICAL STAFF, AS WELL AS THE ARMED FORCES'\nDISABLED AND WOUNDED PERSONNEL, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE VULNERABLE TARGETS OF OUR\nACTIONS.  THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND REITERATES THIS POLICY OF PRINCIPLES AND\nDEMANDS THE SAME BEHAVIOR FROM THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n   4.  FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION OF THE CATHEDRAL BY THE DISABLED, [PRESIDENT\nALFREDO] CRISTIANI IS TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE AN OBJECT OF\nNEGOTIATION, DEMANDING CERTAIN ACTIONS OF THE FMLN.  THIS ATTITUDE BY THE\nARENA GOVERNMENT MIGHT MAKE THE PROBLEM MORE COMPLEX AND MAKE US REVERT TO\nCIRCUMSTANCES WE HAD ALREADY SURPASSED.  THE DEPARTURE FROM THE COUNTRY OF\nTHE DISABLED IS A RIGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD RESPECT, AND THIS CANNOT\nBE CONSIDERED AN ISSUE THAT CAN BE USED FOR NEGOTIATIONS OR BLACKMAIL.\n\n   WE ARE SURE THAT THIS JUST DEMAND WHICH HAS LED THE DISABLED COMRADES TO\nSTAY AT THE CATHEDRAL UNTIL THEY AND THEIR COMRADES CAN LEAVE THE COUNTRY\nWILL BE SUPPORTED BY ALL OF OUR PEOPLE, WHILE INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WILL\nLEAVE IT CLEARLY ESTABLISHED THAT CRISTIANI, ARENA, AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE\nACTING IN AN UNJUST AND INCORRECT MANNER.  [SIGNED] FMLN GENERAL COMMAND, 26\nAUGUST 1989.  ",

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS\nMADE TODAY BY THE COLOMBIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY.\n\n   IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THE AUTHORITIES DISCOVERED THE NUMBERS OF THE\nBANK ACCOUNTS THE DRUG TRAFFICKER HAS IN COLOMBIA AND ABROAD.  THE\nAUTHORITIES CONFISCATED 30 SOPHISTICATED COMPUTERS, TELEFAX, AND OTHER\nELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT. THIS HAS BEEN ANOTHER SEVERE SETBACK FOR RODRIGUEZ\nGACHA, ONE OF THE MAFIA BOSSES MOST WANTED BY THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT.\n\n   RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALIAS THE MEXICAN, IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE RIGHT-HAND\nMAN OF PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, THE MEDELLIN CARTEL'S TOP BOSS.  GACHA'S GROUP\nHAS SUFFERED MANY LOSSES DUE TO THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE GOVERNMENT\nAGAINST COCAINE TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING IN COLOMBIA. OVER THE\nPAST FEW DAYS, ELITE ARMY TROOPS HAVE SEIZED SEVERAL LARGE FARMS OWNED BY\nRODRIGUEZ GACHA IN THE TOWN OF PACHO, AS WELL AS LUXURIOUS RESIDENCES IN\nBOGOTA. A SON OF RODRIGUEZ GACHA, FREDDY RODRIGUEZ CELADES, AND THE GROUP'S\n\"CHIEF OF FINANCES,\" FERNANDO GALEANO BERRIO--WHO IS WANTED BY THE U.S.\nAUTHORITIES--ARE BEING HELD BY COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES.  \n\n   HOWEVER, DESPITE THE \"WAR\" THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED ON THE DRUG\nTRAFFICKING GANGS, A SUPERIOR COURT HAS REVOKED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF\nESCOBAR GAVIRIA, RODRIGUEZ GACHA, AND OTHER PERSONS LINKED TO MASSACRES\nCARRIED OUT BY RIGHTIST MILITARY GROUPS BEING TRAINED BY ISRAELI, BRITISH,\nU.S., AND WEST GERMAN MERCENARIES, ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATIONS.\n\n   THE RULING WAS MADE KNOWN YESTERDAY. TODAY THE COUNTRY IS STILL AMAZED,\nCONSIDERING THAT THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT THE MAFIA LEADERS\nMASTERMINDED THE MASSACRES, AS REPORTED BY JUSTICE MARIA ELENA DIAZ, WHO WAS\nSHOT TO DEATH LAST MONTH, EVIDENTLY AS A REPRISAL FOR HAVING STATED THIS\nOPINION.\n\n   THE ARREST WARRANT ALSO INCLUDED LUIS RUBIO ROJAS, A FORMER MAYOR OF THE\nTOWN OF PUERTO BOYACA, AN OPERATIONS CENTER OF RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY\nELEMENTS, AND SEVERAL ARMY DETACHMENT ELEMENTS WHO REPORTEDLY PROMOTE\nTERRORIST SQUADRONS.  \n\n   IT HAS BEEN FULLY ESTABLISHED THAT ARMED ULTRA-RIGHTIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN\nTRAINED BY FOREIGN MERCENARIES, INCLUDING JAIR KLEIN, A FORMER ISRAELI ARMY\nCOLONEL WHO COMMANDED HIS COUNTRY'S ANTITERRORIST CORPS SEVERAL YEARS AGO.",

AT PRESENT SHE\nIS BOGOTA'S JUSTICE MINISTER, AND IS HIDING IN THE UNITED STATES FROM THE\nDRUG CARTEL'S ASSASSINATION THREATS.\n\n   MINISTER SHAHAL STRESSED THAT IN HIS MEETINGS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION\nHEADS IN COLOMBIA, THE LATTER HAD LAVISHED PRAISE ON THE ASSISTANCE EXTENDED\nBY OUR DEFENSE SECTOR TO COLOMBIA.  \n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [SHAHAL] IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.  ISRAEL TRAINED\nCOLOMBIAN DEFENSE ESTABLISHMENT ELEMENTS; THIS WAS DONE IN THE\nCUSTOMARY WAY AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE DEFENSE MINISTER.  COLOMBIA\nBOUGHT SECURITY PRODUCTS FROM ISRAEL, SUCH AS THE KFIR PLANES, WHICH\nWERE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COAL PURCHASE.  ON THE DAY I MET WITH THE\nCOLOMBIAN PRESIDENT HE SIGNED AN ORDER APPROVING THE PURCHASE OF THE\nKFIR PLANES BY THE COLOMBIAN AIR FORCE.  A DAY LATER WE SIGNED THE\nCOAL AGREEMENT.  THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE DEAL WAS ABOUT $200 TO $250\nMILLION FOR EACH SIDE.  [PASSAGE OMITTED] [END RECORDING]",

HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN\nREPORTED THAT HIS EXTRADITION MAY BE POSTPONED FOR A FEW DAYS BECAUSE THE\nSUPREME COURT SUSPENDED THE DEADLINES FOR THE ELECTION OF JUSTICES AT 27\nHIGHER COURTS.\n\n   THE SUPREME COURT'S CONSTITUTIONAL CHAMBER AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE\n10 WORKING DAYS TO STATE THEIR POSITIONS REGARDING THE LEGALITY OF THE\nEXECUTIVE DECREES, WITHOUT WHICH THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO ABSTAIN FROM\nAUTHORIZING FUTURE EXTRADITIONS.\n\n   \"WE MUST NOT ACT HASTILY BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO MAKE ERRORS.  SOME OF\nTHE EXTRADITABLES MAY BE INNOCENT,\" COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER CARLOS LEMUS\nTOLD AFP.",

      "text": "   MADRID (SPAIN), 31 AUG 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] WE NOW HAVE\nSOME STATEMENTS MADE EXCLUSIVELY TO MADRID RADIO BY A FORMER MEMBER OF\nTHE CHILEAN SECRET POLICE.  JOSE MANUEL MARTIN MEDEM REPORTS:\n\n   [MARTIN MEDEM] THE EXILES FROM CHILE, ARGENTINA, AND URUGUAY REPEATEDLY\nSTATED THAT WHILE THERE WERE MILITARY DICTATORSHIPS IN THEIR COUNTRIES, THE\nARMED FORCES OF THE SOUTHERN HALF OF LATIN AMERICA ACTED JOINTLLY, WITHOUT\nRESPECTING BORDERS, IN REPRESSION.  IN THIS WAY, THEY WERE ABLE TO KIDNAP AN\nEXILE FROM WHERE HE HAD TAKEN REFUGE AND MAKE HIM RETURN TO THE COUNTRY OF\nORIGIN, WHERE MANY WERE TORTURED AND MURDERED.  OUR COLLEAGUE, JAVIER\nGONZALEZ, HAS NOW MANAGED A WITNESS REPORT THAT CONFIRMS THESE ACCUSATIONS.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [GONZALEZ] A FORMER MEMBER OF DINA [NATIONAL\nINTELLEGENCE DIRECTORATE], THE CHILEAN SECRET SERVICE UNDER PINOCHET,\nHAS ASKED REQUESTED POLITICAL ASYLUM IN SPAIN.  HE IS JUAN JOSE SOTO\nVARGAS, WHO WORKED IN THE DINA CITIZENS' INTELLIGENCE BRIGADE.  HE HAS\nTURNED AWAY FROM THE REGIME, ALTHOUGH HE MAINTAINED HIS IDEOLOGICAL\nSTANCE.  SOTO VARGAS, A DOCTOR BY PROFESSION AND A PASTOR OF AN\nEVANGELICAL CHURCH, HAS MADE EXCLUSIVE STATEMENTS TO MADRID RADIO IN\nWHICH HE CONFIRMS POLICE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE REGION'S MILITARY\nGOVERNMENTS DURING THE PERIOD OF STATE TERRORISM.\n\n   [SOTO VARGAS] WE, IN THE CHILEAN EMBASSY, WORKED WITH THE ARGENTINE\nFEDERAL POLICE AND WITH THE ARGENTINE ARMED FORCES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST\nSUBVERSION IN 1976 AND SHORTLY BEFORE ISABEL MARTINEZ DE PERON LEFT POWER.\nWE ALSO WORKED JOINTLY WITH THE SECURITY FORCES OF URAGUAY, PARAGUAY, AND\nBRAZIL.  I WORKED IN THE CHILEAN EMBASSY IN BRAZIL WITH THE AGREEMENT OF THE\nNATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICE OF THE BRAZILIAN CENTRAL AGENCY.  WELL,\nRELATIONS WERE THE BEST AND THIS WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SOUTH AMERICAN ARMED\nFORCES, AT TO INSTALL ITSELF IN SOUTH AMERICA OR TO IMPOSE ITSELF THROUGH\nGUERRILLA TACTICS AND VIOLENCE.\n\n   [GONZALEZ] SOTO VARGAS HAS ALREADY REQUESTED POLITICAL ASYLUM IN OTHER\nEUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHICH HE HAS HAD TO LEAVE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.  HE\nSAYS THAT HE DID NOT TORTURE OR KILL ANYONE AND THAT THINGS LIKE THIS DID\nNOT HAPPEN IN CHILE.  HOWEVER, HE ADMITS THAT GENERAL CARLOS PRATS, THE HEAD\nOF THE ARMY UNDER PRESIDENT ALLENDE, WAS ASSASSINATED IN BUENOS AIRES UNDER\nORDERS OF THE PINOCHET GOVERNMENT.\n\n   [SOTO VARGAS] THERE IS PROOF, EVEN JUDICIAL PROOF, THAT THERE WAS\nPARTICIPATION BY HIGH-RANKING MEMBERS OF THE CHILEAN ARMY WHO WERE ORDERED\nTO CARRY OUT ASSASSINATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I WORKED IN THE MILITARY\nSECTION OF THE CHILEAN EMBASSY IN ARGENTINA, GEN VICTOR HUGO BARRIERA\nBARRIERA OF THE ARMY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AN THERE WAS TALK IN THE CHILEAN\nEMBASSY THAT THE CHILEAN HIGH-RANKING OFFICER HAD ORDERED THE PHYSICAL\nEXTERMINATION OF PRATS.

      "text": "   MOSCOW (USSR), NO DATE -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] FULLY AWARE OF OUR\nRESPONSIBILITY AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHALLENGE, THE PCCH AND THE\nLEFTIST SECTOR, AS PART OF THE OPPOSITION, WILL SPARE NO SACRIFICE TO\nSECURE AN IMPORTANT VICTORY BY ELECTING PATRICIO AYLWIN PRESIDENT OF\nTHE REPUBLIC AND ESTABLISHING A DECISIVE MAJORITY IN CONGRESS FOR THE\nOPPOSITION, INCLUDING THE UNITED LEFT AND THE PAIS [BROAD PARTY OF THE\nSOCIALIST LEFT].\n\n   IN OUR OPINION, SAID VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, THIS IS NOT JUST AN\nELECTORAL CAMPAIGN.  WE DO NOT SEE IT AS SEPARATE FROM THE SOCIAL\nMOBILIZATION CARRIED OUT BY PEOPLE BURDENED BY HUNDREDS OF DAILY\nPROBLEMS, A MOBILIZATION TO RECOVER THEIR RIGHTS TO FOOD, JOBS,\nHEALTH, HOUSING, AND EDUCATION -- TO A WAY OF LIFE WORTHY OF HUMAN\nBEINGS.\n\n   FIVE OR SIX MILLION HUNGRY AND POOR CHILEANS IS A SCANDAL, AND THEY\nDESERVE A SHARE OF THE WEALTH OF THOSE WHO TOOK OVER THE COUNTRY'S\nGOVERNMENT.\n\n   WE NEED TO DEMAND AND DEFEND THE RESPECT FOR LIFE THAT HAS NOT BEEN\nGUARANTEED DURING THESE PAST 16 YEARS IN OUR FATHERLAND.  A SINGLE DAY\nDOES NOT GO BY WITHOUT A DEFENDER OF FREEDOM BECOMING A VICTIM OF THE\nREGIME'S REPRESSIVE APPARATUS.\n\n   THE COMMUNIST REPRESENTATIVE ADDED: WE WANT PEACE FOR CHILE.  WE\nWANT THE DEADLY VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM UNLEASHED ON 11 SEPTEMBER 1973\nTO END ONCE AND FOR ALL.\n\n   THE CHILEAN DILEMMA CONTINUES TO BE DEMOCRACY OR DICTATORSHIP,\nLIBERTY OR TYRANNY, PERPETUATION IN POWER OR A NEW LIFE.  VOLODIA\nTEITELBOIM HAS INDEED MADE A CALL TO GET ORGANIZED, TO UNITE, AND TO\nCONVINCE.  THE PERPETUATION OF POWER IS NOW CALLED HERNAN BUCHI.  WE\nMUST ALL UNITE TO DEFEAT PINOCHET.  BUCHI IS HIS MAN.\n\n   TEITELBOIM POINTED OUT THAT THE PEOPLE DID NOT MAKE A MISTAKE.\nTHEY JUST HAD TO CHANGE A LETTER OF BUCHI'S PROPAGANDISTIC SLOGANS TO\nRESTORE THE TRUTH: BUCHI IS NOT THE MAN; RATHER, HE REPRESENTS HUNGER.\n\n   IN ITS 15TH CONGRESS THE PCCH MADE A CALL TO DEFEAT THE MINISTER\nWHO HAS MADE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE POOR, THE MINISTER WHO HAS NOW BECOME\nA DEMAGOGUE AND IS PROMISING THE MOON AND AN UNREALISTIC WORLD FOR THE\nPEOPLE; THAT IS, THE MINISTER WHO IS PROMISING EVERYTHING HE FAILED TO\nACCOMPLISH IN HIS YEARS AS MINISTER.\n\n   BUCHI'S INSINCERE PROMISES ARE SURPASSED ONLY BY ANOTHER TALKATIVE\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE REGIME: MR ERRAZURIZ.\n\n   VOLODIA TEITELBOIM THEN ADDED: IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THE VICTORY OF\nDEMOCRACY, IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE UNITED FORCES OF ALL THOSE\nWHO HOPE FOR LIBERTY.\n\n   WE HEREBY CALL FOR THE CREATION OF MILLIONS OF COMMANDOS FOR\nDEMOCRACY AND BROAD COMMITTEES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO DISPLAY\nINITIATIVES, ENCOURAGE IMAGINATION, AND FORM CARAVANS OF PEOPLE WHO\nWILL GIVE EXPLANATIONS FROM DOOR TO DOOR AND FROM PERSON TO PERSON,\nIMPLEMENTING A FERVENT AND OVERWHELMING DYNAMIC CAPABLE OF CHANGING\nCHILE ON 14 DECEMBER 1989.\n\n   OUR PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS PLAYED AN OUTSTANDING ROLE IN THE CRUCIAL\nCROSSROADS OF THE 20TH CENTURY.  THEY ARE PLAYING IT NOW, FIGHTING\nWHOLEHEARTEDLY, CONVINCED THAT THE VICTORY OF DEMOCRACY WILL REPRESENT\nA SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARD RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS, AN EMPHATIC AND\nRIGHTEOUS NO TO IMPUNITY, AND A SUBSTANTIVE YES TO LIBERTY FOR ALL\nPOLITICAL PRISONERS AND TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI [NATIONAL\nINTELLIGENCE CENTER].\n\n   THE OUTSTANDING COMMUNIST LEADER AND INTELLECTUAL SAID THAT THESE\nARE DAYS FOR GENEROSITY AND SPIRITUAL GRANDEUR.  SEEKING DEMOCRACY, WE\nARE SHAKING HANDS WITH ALL THOSE WITH WHOM WE HAVE HAD DISAGREEMENTS\nIN THE PAST.  WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS.  ALTHOUGH WE ARE MOTIVATED BY\nDIFFERENT POLITICAL CONCEPTS, THIS IS A CREATIVE TIME FOR A COMMON\nDENOMINATOR, JOINT ACTIONS, AND FOR EVERYONE TO LEND A HAND.\n\n   IF THE OPPOSITION MARCHES UNITED TOWARD 14 DECEMBER, IT WILL\nACHIEVE A OVERWHELMING VICTORY THAT WILL BE REGISTERED IN CHILEAN\nHISTORY AS A GOLDEN DATE OF EXTRAORDINARY SIGNIFICANCE.\n\n   SUCH A VICTORY WILL FINALLY RESTORE A RIGHT THAT HAS REPEATEDLY\nBEEN REQUESTED AND VIOLATED: THE RIGHT TO REJOICE AND TO TRUST IN THE\nFUTURE WITH THE CERTAINTY THAT NO ONE WILL SLIP UNNOTICED THROUGH THE\nSHADOWS OF THE NIGHT TO KILL A CHILEAN WITH IMPUNITY.\n\n   THE PEOPLE, ADDED VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, ARE BEGINNING TO PAINT THE\nWALLS WITH A SLOGAN: THE PEOPLE WIN, THE DICTATORSHIP IS OVER.  THE\nDICTATORSHIP WILL END AND THE PEOPLE WILL WIN.\n\n   IF WE WIN IN 14 DECEMBER AND DOUBTLESSLY WE WILL, AND IF WE --\nALWAYS ACTING IN UNISON -- IMMEDIATELY SPOIL PINOCHET'S PLANS, WE WILL\n[WORD INDISTINCT] THEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE PRESIDENT OR THE PERPETUAL\nBOSS.\n\n   THE TOP LEADER OF CHILEAN COMMUNISTS WARNED THAT THE DANGERS AND\nDIFFICULTIES DEMAND THAT WE REMAIN ALERT AND WORK EVEN HARDER.  WE\nMUST BURY ALL ATTEMPTS BY THE GENERAL AND HIS FAITHFULS TO STOP OR\nREVERSE CHILE'S PROGRESS TOWARD NEW HORIZONS.\n\n   VOLODIA TEITELBOIM POINTED OUT THAT PATRICIO AYLWIN, DURING A\nMEETING AT THE OPENING CEREMONY FOR THE CHRISTIAN LEFT PARTY OFFICES,\nEXPRESSED HIS DESIRE TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A TRULY DEMOCRATIC\nGOVERNMENT THAT WILL MAKE ALL CHILEANS ACTIVE AGAIN IN DEMOCRATIC\nLIFE.  THIS PURPOSE REFLECTS THE SENTIMENTS OF A VAST MAJORITY OF THE\nPEOPLE WHO WANT TO TURN THE BLOODY PAGE OF THE DICTATORSHIP AND PUT AN\nEND TO POLITICAL AND SOCIAL NEGLECT AND TO THE DIVISIONS BETWEEN\nHUMANS, BETWEEN PARIAHS AND PRIVILEGED ONES, AND BETWEEN FIRST-CLASS,\nSECOND-CLASS, OR THIRD-CLASS PEOPLE, WHERE SOME ENJOY EVERY RIGHT\nWHILE OTHERS ARE DENIED EVEN THE RIGHT TO LIVE.\n\n   IN HIS SPEECH OVER A PARTIAL RADIO NETWORK, THE PCCH SECRETARY\nGENERAL SAID: WE DREAM ABOUT AND STRIVE FOR A CHILE WITHOUT MISSING\nPEOPLE, WITHOUT EXECUTED PEOPLE, WITHOUT BURNED YOUTHS, WITHOUT\nPOLITICAL PRISONERS, WITHOUT EXILES -- A FATHERLAND OF EQUALS AMONG\nEQUALS.

ONE OF THE\nLEAFLETS FOUND STATED: KILLED FOR BETRAYING THE REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE\nAND THE PEOPLE. YELLOW AND BOURGEOIS [AS HEARD].\n\n   ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATORS, NEGHME'S BODY RECEIVED 18 BULLET\nWOUNDS, CAUSED BY 12 DIRECT HITS. THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT BY A\nGROUP OF ARMED INDIVIDUALS IN A MOVING CAR. NOTHING IS KNOWN ABOUT THE\nATTACKERS.\n\n   CARABINEROS PERSONNEL WENT TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME AFTER\nRECEIVING A TELEPHONE CALL. HOMICIDE EXPERTS FROM THE CIVILIAN POLICE\nARRIVED A LITTLE LATER. THEY IMMEDIATELY CONDUCTED THE APPROPRIATE\nINVESTIGATIONS WHERE THE MIR SPOKESMAN WAS GUNNED DOWN.  NEGHME WAS\nKILLED SOME 50 METERS FROM THE BERNARDO O'HIGGINS PROMENADE, AT 10\nWEST BULNES STREET. THE STREET IS POORLY ILLUMINATED. IT IS BELIEVED\nTHAT THERE WERE NO EYEWITNESSES OF THE CRIME.\n\n   ACCORDING TO POLICE SOURCES, TWO AUTOMATIC WEAPONS WERE USED; ONE A\n7.65-MM AND THE OTHER A 9-MM. THE POLICE ADDED THAT NEGHME WAS NOT\nCARRYING A WEAPON. A BRIEFCASE FOUND NEAR HIS BODY CONTAINED SOME\nSPEECHES AND A BOOK ON CHILEAN HISTORY.",

      "text": "   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 5 SEP 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE EXTENSIVE BORDER\nSHARED BY VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA IS TODAY, MORE THAN EVER, THE CAUSE\nOF CONCERN FOR THE CARACAS GOVERNMENT.  THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKING ORDERED BY PRESIDENT BARCO IS VIEWED BY LOCAL COMMENTATORS\nAS A DANGEROUS THREAT TO VENEZUELA DUE TO ITS PROXIMITY TO COLOMBIA,\nWITH WHOM VENEZUELA SHARES OVER 2,000 KM.\n\n   THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR\nVENEZUELAN GOVERNMENTS.  ON SEVERAL OCASSIONS VENEZUELA HAD TO FACE\nRAIDS INTO ITS TERRITORY, AS WELL AS THE KIDNAPPING OF STOCKBREEDERS,\nSMUGGLING OF GOODS, AND DRUG TRAFFICKING BY COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS AND\nCRIMINALS.  THE WAR DECLARED BY THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ON THE\nMEDELLIN CARTEL OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY THAT MANY OF THE DRUG\nCHIEFTAINS, AND PERHAPS SOME DRUG KINGPINS, MAY SEEK REFUGE IN\nVENEZUELAN TERRITORY.\n\n   VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ WARNED THAT IF DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS ATTEMPT TO TRANSFER THEIR INDUSTRIES TO VENEZUELA THEY\nWILL HAVE TO \"FACE VENEZUELAN JUSTICE, AND CERTAINLY EXTRADITION\nTRIALS.\" THE STATES OF ZULIA, TACHIRA, AND APURE --IN WESTERN\nVENEZUELA -- BORDER COLOMBIAN TERRITORY AND HAVE BEEN THE SCENE OF\nDRUG TRAFFICKING OPERATIONS MANY TIMES.  IN THE PAST FEW DAYS\nVENEZUELAN SECURITY FORCES HAVE INCREASED VIGILANCE AT THE MAIN BORDER\nPOSTS BECAUSE OF RUMORS THAT DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE BEGUN MOVING TO\nVENEZUELA.\n\n   GOVERNOR OF ZULIA STATE ISMAEL ORDAZ CONFIRMED TO NEWSMEN THAT THE\nGOVERNMENT HAS INTENSIFIED CONTROL AND VIGILANCE MEASURES AT THE\nBORDER WITH COLOMBIA.  HE NOTED THERE IS BROAD COOPERATION BETWEEN THE\nVENEZUELAN AND COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG\nTRAFFICKING.\n\n   DURING A RADIO PROGRAM ON MONDAY, 4 SEPTEMBER, JOURNALIST JOSE\nVICENTE RANGEL, FORMER MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIALISM PRESIDENTIAL\nCANDIDATE, MAINTAINED THAT IT IS NOT AT THIS TIME THAT DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO ENTER VENEZUELA BECAUSE THEY ENTERED A\nLONG TIME AGO.  RANGEL MAINTAINED THAT VENEZUELA ANNUALLY SERVES AS A\nBRIDGE FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING WORTH SOME $20 BILLION.  FURTHERMORE, HE\nSAID, THE EXPENSIVE VENEZUELAN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS HAVE ALSO RECEIVED\nRESOURCES OBTAINED FROM DRUG TRAFFICKING.\n\n   THE FIGURES GIVEN BY RANGEL ARE EQUIVALENT TO 66 PERCENT OF THE\nVENEZUELAN FOREIGN DEBT, WHICH AMOUNTS TO SOME $30 MILLION THAT THE\nGOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY TRYING TO RENEGOTIATE.  MOREOVER, RANGEL SAID,\nDURING THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN THAT CONCLUDED WITH THE ELECTION OF\nCARLOS ANDRES PEREZ IN DECEMBER 1988, POLITICAL PARTIES INVESTED SOME\n5 BILLION BOLIVARES (SOME $135 MILLION) IN PROPAGANDA.  THIS FIGURE IS\nEXCESSIVE IF ONE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT, AS ESTABLISHED BY THE LAW,\nTHE STATE ONLY CONTRIBUTES 100 MILLION BOLIVARES ($2.7 MILLION) FOR\nTHE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS HELD EVERY 5 YEARS.\n\n   RANGEL ADDED THAT THE POSSIBLE TRANSFER OF COLOMBIAN DRUG\nTRAFFICKING OPERATION CENTERS TO VENEZUELA IS VERY WORRYING IF ONE\nTAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE OPENLY\nADMITTED THE LACK OF VIGILANCE AT THE BORDERS.  HOWEVER, WHILE\nCOLOMBIA IS ATTEMPTING, PERHAPS BELATEDLY, NOT TO YIELD TO THE\nECONOMIC POWER AND VIOLENCE OF DRUGS, THERE SEEMS TO BE NO AWARENESS\nIN VENEZUELA ABOUT THE GRAVE DANGER POSED BY THE ALLEGED CHANGE OF\nADDRESS WHICH, ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS, IS BEING PLANNED BY\nCOLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS.",

      "text": "   LIMA, NO DATE (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [SPEECH] [GARCIA] [TEXT]\n[CONTINUED] IT IS CLEAR THAT NEO-LIBERALISM IS THE IDEOLOGY OF THE\nNORTH.  IF IN THE PAST LIBERALISM WAS A FACTOR THAT PROMOTED PROGRESS\nAND INDEPENDENCE IN LATIN AMERICA, NEO- LIBERALISM IS NOW THE STATE\nIDEOLOGY OF THE MORE POWERFUL NATIONS.  IT IS AN AUTHORITARIAN\nIDEOLOGY THAT DOES NOT QUESTION ALL TYPES OF STATES, BUT ONLY THE\nSTATES OF THE SOUTH.  UNDER THE GUISE OF ELIMINATING BUREAUCRACY AND\nPROMOTING EFFICIENCY, NEO-LIBERALISM WANTS TO DESTROY THE STATE TO\nELIMINATE ANY RESISTANCE TO THE HEGEMONY OF THE WORLD MARKET.\n\n   WE SHOULD NOT PLAY THAT GAME.  IDEOLOGICAL NONALIGNMENT SHOULD\nTHEREFORE REDEFINE THE STATE AND DEFEND ITS STRENGTH IN OUR COUNTRIES.\n\n   WHEN I SAY STATE I AM NOT REFERRING MERELY TO THE INDIVIDUAL STATES\nTHAT EVERY ONE OF US REPRESENTS.  I AM REFERRING TO AN ACCORD THAT OUR\nSTATES SHOULD REACH IN EACH REGION.  WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE\nUNITED IN CONTINENTAL BLOCS.  WE MUST PROMOTE OUR REGIONAL ECONOMY.\n\n   ONLY THROUGH REGIONAL INITIATIVES WILL WE HAVE POWER IN THE CURRENT\nPROCESS OF RESTRUCTURING THE MARKET.  IT IS THEREFORE IMPERATIVE TO\nCALL -- IN EACH CONTINENT -- MORE FREQUENT AND REGULAR MEETINGS OF OUR\nMOVEMENT.  WE MUST ORGANIZE THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT ON A CONTINENTAL\nBASIS TO STRENGTHEN IT IN ALL PLACES.\n\n   MANY HAVE COME TO THIS MEETING TO PROPOSE AN ADMINISTRATIVE\nSTRUCTURE FOR OUR MOVEMENT TO INSURE ITS CONTINUITY.  THIS CAN BE\nVIEWED AS A SUGGESTION.  IT IS A LOT MORE IMPORTANT, THOUGH, TO\nRECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AND TO CREATE\nINTERMEDIATE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT ORGANIZATIONS WHEREVER POSSIBLE.\nTHESE INTERMEDIATE ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE PRINCIPLES OF\nTHE MOVEMENT IN EACH REGION, THUS EXPANDING ITS POWER.\n\n   ALTHOUGH IT'S TAKEN SOMETIME, I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY\nADOPTED THIS APPROACH IN LATIN AMERICA THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE\nPOLITICAL CONSULTATION MECHANISM OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT, WHICH GIVES\nCOMMON ANSWERS TO THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND TO POLITICAL INTERVENTION.\n\n   MR PRESIDENT, IN HONORING OUR FOUNDERS -- TITO, NEHRU, AND NASSER\n-- I SHOULD STRESS THE ETHICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF NONALIGNMENT.  WITHOUT\nTHE POWER OF NUCLEAR BOMBS OR MONEY, WE HAVE UPHELD THE MORAL VALUES\nOF MANKIND TO HELP IT TO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE IN ALL FIELDS.\n\n   THEREFORE, OUR MOVEMENT CANNOT REMAIN INDIFFERENT TO THE VERY\nSERIOUS PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING AND DRUG ADDICTION, WHICH HAS\nSPREAD AROUND THE WORLD.\n\n   IT IS TRUE THAT THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS RICH\nCOUNTRIES, BECAUSE DRUG ADDICTION REFLECTS THE MOST REFINED STAGE OF\nCONSUMPTION, THE CONSUMPTION OF INSATISFACTION.  YET IT IS ALSO TRUE\nTHAT WE, AS DRUG PRODUCERS OR DEALERS, ARE INVOLUNTARY PARTNERS.  LIKE\nNEO- LIBERALISM, DRUG TRAFFICKING HAS PERVERSELY TRIED TO TAKE OVER.\n\n   DRUG TRAFFICKING IS ALSO A FORM OF HEGEMONY BY THE LARGE RICH\nMARKETS, WHICH ARE THEREBY DISTORTING AND CORRUPTING OUR SOCIETY.\nDRUG TRAFFICKING ALSO SEEKS TO DESTROY STATES, AS IT IS NOW DOING IN\nCOLOMBIA.\n\n   I BELIEVE WE SHOULD RAISE THE BANNER OF MANKIND'S MORAL VALUES; WE\nSHOULD TELL THE RICH THAT EVEN IF THEY IGNORE OUR CLAIMS FOR JUSTICE,\nWE WILL NOT IGNORE THEIR YOUTH AND THEIR CHILDREN, WHO MUST BE\nDEFENDED FROM DRUG ADDICTION.\n\n   THE U.S. PRESIDENT WILL FORMULATE A PROPOSAL ON THE SUBJECT\nTOMORROW, AND WE HOPE IT WILL BE AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING PROPOSAL.\n\n   THE PROBLEM IS NOT JUST OVER HELICOPTERS AN AMMUNITION.  IT\nINVOLVES AN ACCORD BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, ON ONE SIDE,\nAND THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED ON THE OTHER.\n\n   THE PRODUCTION OF DRUGS, IN PARTICULAR, CALLS FOR STRUCTURAL\nTREATMENT, WITHOUT WHICH ANY MILITARY AID WILL BE INSUFFICIENT.\n\n   OUR MOVEMENT MUST ADOPT A STRONG STAND AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING AND\nUNDERTAKE JOINT MEASURES TO ERADICATE IT.  THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT\nMUST ALSO ADOPT A STRONG STAND AGAINST TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT\nIS LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING, AS IN PERU.\n\n   FAITHFUL TO ITS MORAL PRINCIPLES, THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT SHOULD\nSTRONGLY REJECT DRUG ADDICTION AND DEATH.  THIS WILL SHOW THAT OUR\nNATIONS' RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY IS AS STRONG AS THAT OF THE MOST\nDEVELOPED COUNTRIES.\n\n   MR PRESIDENT: WE CAME TO THIS SUMMIT FROM PERU TO REITERATE OUR\nFAITH IN NONALIGNMENT, OUR ANTI-IMPERIALIST POSITION AGAINST\nCOLONIALISM AND INTERVENTIONISM, AND OUR DECISION TO SIDE WITH THE\nNATIONS STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM AND JUSTICE.  WE CAME TO DEFEND\nIDEOLOGICAL NONALIGNMENT.  WE CAME TO DEMAND FINANCIAL DISARMAMENT AND\nTHE RECOGNITION OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE DEBT.  WE ARE HERE TO\nREITERATE OUR ALLEGIANCE TO THE IMMORTAL PRINCIPLES THAT WE UNITED\nBEHIND 28 YEARS AGO.\n\n   I SALUTE THE NATIONS OF THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT.  THANK YOU VERY\nMUCH. [APPLAUSE]",

THE ANONYMOUS CALLER GAVE NO EXPLANATION\nFOR THE ATTACK, A CARACOL NEWSMAN TOLD REUTER.\n\n   TWO WEEKS AGO THE EXTRADITABLES DECLARED \"TOTAL WAR\" AGAINST THE\nGOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO AFTER HE LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN TO\nREPRESS THE DRUG BARONS IN WHICH 11,000 INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED AND\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROPERTY OWNED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE\nCONFISCATED.",

[END RECORDING]\n\n   THIS IS HOW PRESIDENT BUSH BEGAN HIS SPEECH, IN WHICH HE DELIVERED\nHIS PLAN TO U.S. CITIZENS ON FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THE HUGE\nNUMBER OF DRUG USERS MADE THE GOVERNMENT INCREASE THE $2 BILLION\nBUDGET LAST YEAR.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUSH] AS YOU CAN SEE ON THIS CHART, IN 1985 THE\nGOVERNMENT ESTIMATED THAT 23 MILLION U.S. CITIZENS WERE USING DRUGS ON\nA CASUAL BASIS; THAT IS, AT LEAST ONCE DURING THE PAST MONTH.  LAST\nYEAR, THIS FIGURE DROPPED BY OVER 1\/3, WHICH MEANS THAT 9 MILLION U.S.\nCITIZENS HAVE CEASED BEING OCCASIONAL DRUG USERS.  ALTHOUGH THE\nOVERALL COCAINE USAGE HAS DROPPED, THE FREQUENT USE OF COCAINE HAS\nALMOST DOUBLED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.  THESE ARE THE CASUAL COCAINE\nUSERS, THOSE WHO CONSUME CRACK, AND WHO REPRESENT THE MOST SERIOUS AND\nURGENT PROBLEM. [END RECORDING]\n\n   PRESIDENT BUSH'S ADVISERS SAID THE PRESIDENT IS AWARE OF THE\nDIFFICULTIES OF THE PLAN, HOWEVER HE BELIEVES THIS IS THE FIRST STEP\nIN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUGS.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [BUSH] TODAY, I SENT THIS DOCUMENT.  OUR FIRST\nNATIONAL STRATEGY ON DRUG CONTROL.  I SENT IT TO THE CONGRESS.

SINCE THE BEGINNING OF OUR TRUCE, ARCE BATTALION TROOPS\nHAVE BEGUN TO ENTER OUR TERRITORIES.  THUS, THE CASUALTIES SUSTAINED\nBY THE ARCE BATTALION ARE A RESULT OF ACTIONS IN WHICH THE FMLN ACTED\nIN DEFENSE OF ITS FORCES.\n\n   2. ALL ENEMY UNITS THAT CROSS THE TOROLA RIVER DURING AN OPERATION\n[WORD INDISTINCT] BECOME A MILITARY TARGET AND MORE SO IN THIS CASE,\nBECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES BOMBED AND STRAFFED PERQUIN CIVILIANS, AMONG\nWHOM THERE HAVE BEEN CASUALTIES.\n\n   3. WE REITERATE OUR POSITION OF MAINTAINING THE TRUCE DURING THE\nESTABLISHED DAYS JUST AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING, ALTHOUGH UP UNTIL NOW THE\nREGIME HAS FAILED TO EXPRESS ANY GOODWILL; HAS REFUSED TO ALLOW THE\nEVACUATION OF THE WAR DISABLED; AND HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF\nBOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.",

      "text": "   HAVANA (CUBA), NO DATE (CUBAVISION TELEVISION) -- [SPEECH] [CASTRO]\n[TEXT] [CONTINUED] I BELIEVE THAT MANY HAVE BEEN PREPARING THEMSELVES\nDURING THE LAST YEARS.  WHATEVER COURSE HISTORY MAY TAKE IN THE\nFUTURE, WE KNOW THAT HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS HAVE PREPARED THEMSELVES,\nAND WE KNOW THAT IN THEIR WISDOM THE CHILEAN PEOPLE WILL NOT ALLOW\nSUCH A SAD HISTORY TO BE REPEATED, BE WHENEVER IT MAY.  [APPLAUSE]\n\n   WE HAVE NOT SOWN IN THE DESERT OR PLOWED AT SEA.  THESE PAST 16\nYEARS REPRESENT AN EXPERIENCE WHOSE VALUE IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO\nASSESS.  IT IS CLEAR THAT IMPORTANT STEPS FORWARD HAVE BEEN TAKEN.  IT\nIS CLEAR THAT THE PLEBISCITE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY A STEP FORWARD.  I\nREMEMBER THE DAY WE UNVEILED ALLENDE'S BUST AT THE HOSPITAL.  I\nEXPRESSED THE CERTAINTY THAT THE CHILEAN PEOPLE WOULD VOTE AGAINST\nPINOCHET, DESPITE PINOCHET'S RESOURCES AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE\nAND TERRORIST METHODS THAT WERE USED TO INTIMIDATE THE MASSES.  IT\nWOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PEOPLE TO FORGET THE MANY CRIMES AND\nMONSTROSITIES THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED.  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.\n\n   IN EFFECT, THE PLEBISCITE WAS A HARSH BLOW FOR PINOCHET. I THINK\nALSO THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL BE AN EXTREMELY HARSH BLOW, PERHAPS AN\nIRREVERSIBLE BLOW, TO PINOCHET.  HOWEVER, IT IS A FACT THAT NOBODY CAN\nASSERT HERE THAT PINOCHET'S DEFEAT IN THE ELECTION WILL BE THE\nSOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF THE DICTATORSHIP IN CHILE.  I AM NOT\nTALKING ABOUT A REVOLUTION.  I THINK IT WOULD BE UNNECESSARY.  THERE\nWOULD BE NO SENSE IN TALKING HERE ABOUT A REVOLUTION [WORD INDISTINCT]\nA STAGE ABOVE THE DEMOCRATIC OPENING.  WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A\nDEMOCRATIC OPENING, BUT THE ELECTORAL VICTORY DOES NOT ENTAIL A SOLID\nDEMOCRATIC OPENING YET.  HOWEVER, IN OUR OPINION IT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY\nREPRESENT ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD.\n\n   PINOCHET WILL TRY TO STAY ON AS HEAD OF THE ARMY AND AS HEAD OF THE\nARMED FORCES.  WE COULD ALMOST SAY THAT HE WILL STAY ON AS A SORT OF\nSENTINEL, A POWER ON WHICH THE COUNTRY'S DESTINY WOULD CONTINUE TO\nHANG FOR SOME TIME TO COME.  WHETHER HE CAN REALLY FULFILL THE GOALS\nHE HAS SET FOR HIMSELF REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  HOWEVER, I AM CERTAIN HE\nWILL NOT GIVE UP POWER WITHOUT A STRUGGLE.  ONLY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE\nCAN MAKE THIS AN IRREVERSIBLE STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE A TRUE AND FULL\nDEMOCRATIC OPENING, AN OPENING WITHOUT ALL OF THE LIMITATIONS THAT THE\nREGIME HAS WRITTEN INTO ITS CONSTITUTION, WHICH GRANTS HIM ALL OF\nTHESE RIGHTS -- TO BE A SENATOR FOR LIFE, AND, IF MY MEMORY DOES NOT\nFAIL ME, TO SERVE AS CHIEF OF THE ARMY FOR AN ADDITIONAL 8 YEARS.\nLOOK AT HIS HARANGUES.  HIS HARANGUES ARE STILL AGGRESSIVE, HAUGHTY,\nAND THREATENING.  WE HEAR WARNINGS.  WE HEAR APPEALS TO THE ARMY TO\nREMAIN UNITED, BECAUSE HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY TRY TO PERPETUATE HIMSELF.\n\n   I THINK HE WILL BE MORE AND MORE CORNERED BY THE CHILEAN PEOPLE,\nBECAUSE A NEW STAGE WILL BEGIN AFTER THE ELECTIONS.  IT IS INEVITABLE\nTHAT THE PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE TO A MUCH GREATER EXTENT.  THEY WILL\nINEVITABLY HAVE A MUCH GREATER POSSIBILITY OF EXPRESSING THEMSELVES,\nOF ACTING, OF MOBILIZING, OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AT THE\nMOMENT AND NOT ABOUT SHARES OF POWER.  I THINK THEY HAVE TO\nBE...[CHANGES THOUGHT] THAT THIS IS REALLY AN ADMIRABLE TEST OF\nPATRIOTIC AND REVOLUTIONARY FEELING FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT RIGHTISTS,\nFOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT CONSERVATIVES, FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT EVEN IN THE\nCENTER BUT ON THE LEFT, AND WELL TO THE LEFT: TO GO TO THE POLLS AND\nTO VOTE, FORGETTING WHICH PARTY IT WAS THAT PUT FORWARD THE CANDIDATE\nFOR PRESIDENT, OR WHAT THE CANDIDATE'S POLITICAL THINKING IS, JUST\nTHINKING OF CHILE, ONLY THINKING OF CHILE.

      "text": "   BUENOS AIRES, 19 SEP 89 (NA) -- [TEXT] VICE PRESIDENT EDUARDO\nDUHALDE SAID TODAY THAT THE PROBLEM CREATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN\nCOLOMBIA \"CANNOT\" OCCUR IN ARGENTINA BECAUSE IN COLOMBIA THE DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS PRACTICALLY CREATED A \"PARALLEL GOVERNMENT WITH THE IDEA\nOF TAKING POWER.\"\n\n   DUHALDE SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF \"SENDING TROOPS TO THAT COUNTRY IF ITS\nLEADERS REQUEST THEM\" BECAUSE IN COLOMBIA THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS NOT\nONLY BUY \"LARGE ENTERPRISES, COMPANIES, BANKS, AND OFFICES,\" BUT ALSO\n\"HAVE THEIR OWN POLITICIANS, POLICEMEN, TEACHERS, AND OFFICIALS.\"\n\n   IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH NA DUHALDE CALLED ON SOCIETY TO THE\n\"PREVENT\" DRUG ADDICTION IN ARGENTINA.\n\n   THE COLOMBIAN SITUATION \"IS A MILITARY ISSUE BECAUSE A REAL WAR IS\nTAKING PLACE,\" DUHALDE SAID. HE ADDED THAT COLOMBIA IS \"DIVIDED INTO\nTWO COUNTRIES: THE LEGAL COUNTRY AND THE ONE RUN BY NARCOTICS.\" HE\nSAID, \"I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE LEGAL WILL WIN.\"\n\n   ACCORDING TO DUHALDE WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN COLOMBIA \"CANNOT OCCUR\nIN ARGENTINA FOR SEVERAL DECADES.\" HE SAID THAT HE PERSONALLY SUPPORTS\nTHE IDEA OF \"SENDING TROOPS TO COLOMBIA IF ITS LEADERS REQUEST THEM.\"\nHOWEVER, HE EXPLAINED: \"THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE RESOLVED BY\nCONGRESS.\"\n\n   HE POINTED OUT THAT \"DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY OPERATING IN\nTHE COUNTRY BUT THEIR NATIONALITIES ARE NOT KNOWN.\" HE ADDED THAT\n\"THERE IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT DISTRIBUTES THE DRUG IN ARGENTINA.\"\n\n   DUHALDE SAID: \"WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN COLOMBIA IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE\nOF WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE CONTINENT -- THE PRODUCTION AND\nTRAFFICKING OF DRUGS.\" HE ADDED: \"DRUGS ARE NOT PRODUCED IN ARGENTINA.\nTHEY ARE BROUGHT FROM COLOMBIA, BOLIVIA, AND PERU.\"\n\n   HE SAID: \"IN 1988 IN MY BOOK 'POLITICIANS AND DRUGS' I WARNED ABOUT\nTHE CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS CLOSELY LINKED TO\nTERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS SHINING PATH IN PERU AND M-19 IN\nCOLOMBIA.\"\n\n   DUHALDE INDICATED THAT \"THE STRUGGLE IS AGAINST THE DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS. IDEOLOGIES ARE NOT INVOLVED HERE\nBECAUSE, FOR EXAMPLE, IN COLOMBIA THE TRAFFICKERS ARE OF THE EXTREME\nRIGHT -- NATIONALISTS.\"\n\n   HE ADDED THAT \"THE DRUG ADDICTION PROBLEM IN ARGENTINA INVOLVES\nYOUTHS FROM 13 TO 20 YEARS OF AGE\" AND THAT THAT IS WHY \"PREVENTION\nMEASURES SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS, WHERE WE SHOULD TELL THE TRUTH\nABOUT THE ILLS DRUGS CAUSE.\"\n\n   DUHALDE, WHO IS GOING TO TOUR THE COUNTRY TO LECTURE ON \"HOW TO\nPREVENT DRUG ADDICTION,\" SAID THAT \"IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO\nINCLUDE THAT ISSUE IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, BECAUSE TEACHERS CAN\nBECOME THE REAL FORCE FOR ENDING DRUG ADDICTION.\"\n\n   HE REVEALED THAT COCAINE CONSUMPTION IN THE COUNTRY IS COMING CLOSE\nTO MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION, WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIGHER.\" HE SAID THAT\nIT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE \"VERY HARSH REGULATIONS,\" SUCH AS THE DEATH\nPENALTY, \"FOR PEOPLE WHO COMMIT HOMICIDES AS THEY ARE DOING IN\nCOLOMBIA.\"\n\n   REGARDING THE CHAOTIC COLOMBIAN SITUATION, DUHALDE SAID: \"DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS ARE A SORT OF PARALLEL GOVERNMENT THAT AIMS TO TAKE POWER.\nI BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE EVEN IF THEY HAVE\nTHEIR OWN POLITICIANS, POLICEMEN, TEACHERS, AND OFFICIALS.\"\n\n   HE SAID: \"THIS IS NOT ONLY A COLOMBIAN PROBLEM; IT IS A CONTINENTAL\nPROBLEM THAT NO ONE CAN SOLVE ALONE, NOT EVEN THE UNITED STATES. THAT\nIS WHY JOINT ACTION IS NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE THOSE TRAFFICKERS IN\nDEATH.\"\n\n   REGARDING HIS RECENT TRIP TO THE UNITED STATES, DUHALDE SAID THAT\nHIS TALKS \"DID NOT INCLUDE POSSIBLE U.S. MILITARY AID TO THE COUNTRIES\nWITH DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEMS, BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN SITUATION HAD\nNOT YET DEVELOPED TO ITS CURRENT STAGE.\"\n\n   HE CALLED THE COLOMBIAN CARTELS \"MAFIA GANGS\" THAT ARE \"TRYING TO\nSET UP A DISTRIBUTION NETWORK\" FOR THEIR MERCHANDISE WHICH GIVES THEM\nA PROFIT OF ABOUT $150 BILLION A YEAR ON SALES OF $500 BILLION.\"\n\n   DUHALDE SAID THAT \"THE DRUG LORDS BUY LARGE ENTERPRISES, COMPANIES,\nBANKS, AND OFFICES. THEY ALSO FORM RELATIONS WITH POLITICIANS AND\nMILITARY MEN.\" HE ADDED THAT \"THEY HAVE A GREAT ABILITY TO CORRUPT,\"\nAND \"THEY SETTLE IN ONE PLACE WHEN THEY ARE SURE THEY WILL NOT BE\nARRESTED.\"  ",

      "text": "   MEXICO CITY (MEXICO), 22 SEP 89 (REUTER) -- [ARTICLE] [PAUL\nIREDALE] [TEXT] ACCORDING TO WESTERN DIPLOMATS, COLOMBIAN DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS HAVE MOVED TO GUATEMALA IN SEARCH OF NEW SUPPLY ROUTES,\nBRINGING INSTABILITY TO A COUNTRY THAT IS EXPERIENCING A WAVE OF\nVIOLENCE FROM VARIOUS SECTORS.\n\n   THE DIPLOMATS BELIEVE THAT UP TO 200 COLOMBIANS LINKED TO THE\nMEDELLIN AND CALI CARTELS ARE NOW OPERATING IN GUATEMALA AND THAT\nABOUT 500 KG OF COCAINE PASS EVERY WEEK THROUGH THE COUNTRY,\nESSENTIALLY ENROUTE TO THE U.S. MARKET.\n\n   THE INCREASING DRUG TRAFFICKING ACTIVITY COINCIDES WITH A NEW WAVE\nOF KIDNAPPINGS, BOMBINGS, AND MURDERS IN GUATEMALA, AWAKENING FEARS\nTHAT THE COUNTRY WILL RETURN TO THE VIOLENCE PREVALENT AT THE\nBEGINNING OF THE DECADE, WHEN THOUSANDS WERE KILLED BY DEATH SQUADS\nDURING MILITARY REGIMES.\n\n   SINCE AUGUST, A PROMINENT POLITICIAN, A WELL-KNOWN BANKER, AND AT\nLEAST FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE BEEN MURDERED.  SEVERAL BOMBS HAVE\nEXPLODED IN THE CAPITAL IN RECENT MONTHS AND STUDENTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS\nACTIVISTS ARE MISSING.\n\n   \"ALL OF THIS VIOLENCE CANNOT BE BLAMED ON A [WORDS INDISTINCT], BUT\nTHE INCREASE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING IS CLEARLY AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN.\"\n\n   IN ADDITION TO THE COCAINE, WHICH THE DIPLOMATS SAY IS TAKEN TO THE\nUNITED STATES ABOARD LIGHT PLANES OR IN AUTOMOBILES THROUGH MEXICO AND\nTEXAS, U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASE IN OPIUM PRODUCTION IN\nGUATEMALA.  ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES, THE NUMBER OF HECTARES PLANTED\nWENT FROM 225 IN 1985 TO 1,500 THIS YEAR.\n\n   THERE ARE INSISTENT RUMORS THAT BANKER RAMIRO CASTILLO LOVE WAS\nMURDERED OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE ON 25 AUGUST BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO LAUNDER\nDRUG MONEY.  THERE IS OPEN TALK IN THE CAPITAL ABOUT IMPORTANT\nPOLITICIANS BEING LINKED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING.\n\n   NEVERTHELESS, THE DIPLOMATS SAY THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO BACK\nSUCH SPECULATION AND THEY ADD THAT IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT SEVERAL\nINTERESTS ARE WORKING TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY'S FRAGILE DEMOCRACY.\n\n   \"IT SEEMS AS IF SEVERAL STRINGS ARE BEING PULLED AT THE SAME TIME,\"\nA DIPLOMAT SAID.\n\n   WHILE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HAS GIVEN\nGUATEMALA A RESPITE, AFTER DECADES OF MILITARY REGIMES DURING WHICH IT\nIS BELIEVED THAT MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF\nPOLITICAL VIOLENCE, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 1,200 LEFTIST\nGUERRILLAS ARE STILL FIGHTING IN THE MOUNTAINS.\n\n   FURTHERMORE, THE COUNTRY HAS FACED TWO COUP ATTEMPTS SINCE\nDEMOCRACY WAS RESTORED IN 1986.\n\n   THE ULTRA-RIGHT-WING, WITH ITS TIES TO THE LAND-OWNING OLIGARCHY,\nCONTINUES TO BE A POWERFUL FORCE IN THE COUNTRY.  IT HAS BLOCKED A\nMAJORITY OF REFORMS THAT CEREZO HAS TRIED TO INTRODUCE AND, ACCORDING\nTO THE GENERAL CONSENSUS, IT HAS PROMOTED DISCONTENT AMONG THE ARMED\nFORCES' MID-LEVEL OFFICERS.\n\n   \"THE ULTRA-RIGHT-WING IS UNDOUBTEDLY BEHIND PART OF THE VIOLENCE,\"\nSAID A DIPLOMAT.  \"IT COULD BE TRYING TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO\nOVERREACT OR CAUSE THE ARMY TO GET INVOLVED.\"\n\n   AS IF TO CONFIRM THIS, A POLICE ARREST WARRANT HAS BEEN ISSUED\nAGAINST FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LIONEL SISNIEGA, A NOTED\nPOLITICIAN WHO LEANS TO THE RIGHT AND HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN COUP\nATTEMPTS SINCE 1954, ON CHARGES OF HEADING A GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR\nMUCH OF THE VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY.\n\n   DIPLOMATS HAVE ALSO POINTED TO THE RESURGENCE OF ACTIVITIES BY\nLEFT-WING GUERRILLAS WHO HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO TOPPLE SUCCESSIVE\nGOVERNMENTS OVER THE PAST 2 DECADES.\n\n   \"NOWADAYS THEY ARE USING MUCH MORE OBVIOUS TACTICS, ERECTING\nBARRICADES ON HIGHWAYS AND OCCUPYING SMALL TOWNS NEAR THE CAPITAL,\"\nONE DIPLOMAT SAID.\n\n   FEAR THAT THE VIOLENCE OF THE SEVENTIES WILL RETURN MAY ALSO\nCONTRIBUTE TOWARD A RESURGENCE IN THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS\nTHAT CROSS OVER TO MEXICO.\n\n   MEXICAN AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THE NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED CENTRAL\nAMERICANS DEPORTED TO GUATEMALA HAS DOUBLED OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS.\n\n   THE DIPLOMATS FEEL THAT CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT WILL WEATHER THE\nVIOLENCE AND PASS IT ONTO HIS SUCCESSOR AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL\nELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 1990.\n\n   \"PERHAPS THE SITUATION IS THE RESULT OF THE PREPARATION FOR\nELECTIONS IN GUATEMALA,\" A DIPLOMAT SAID.  \"THINGS WILL PROBABLY\nWORSEN NEXT YEAR.\"  ",

GENERAL LARIOS MADE THESE STATEMENTS TO\nFOUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MEDIA REPORTERS.  HERE ARE EXCERPTS OF\nGENERAL LARIOS' STATEMENTS WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THAT THE ARMED FORCES\nWOULD CONSIDER A REDUCTION IN TROOPS.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [LARIOS] [IN PROGRESS] ... WHEN IT INVOLVES\nDAMAGING THE INSTITUTION -- IN THIS CASE THE ARMED FORCES -- WE MUST\nUNDERSTAND THAT WE WERE NOT BORN ON A WHIM, OR BY HAPPENSTANCE OR\nACCIDENT.  WE ARE A CONSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTION AND THE CONSTITUTION\nHAS ESTABLISHED CLEAR TASKS FOR US.  THUS, OUR INSTITUTION IS\nAUTHENTIC AND LEGAL.\n\n   BECAUSE OF THIS, THE CONCEPT OR CRITERIA OF A REDUCTION IN ARMED\nFORCES PERSONNEL CAN BE MANAGED IF IT IS BASED ON VERY PARTICULAR AND\nSPECIFIC TERMS.  IF, FOR EXAMPLE, WE REACH A POLITICAL AGREEMENT WITH\nTHE TERRORIST FORCES FOR THEIR PEACEFUL RETURN TO THE COUNTRY'S\nDEMOCRATIC LIFE, THEN THIS WOULD MEAN THE END OF THE ARMED CONFLICT.\nIT WOULD ALSO MEAN THAT WE, AS THE COUNTRY'S ARMED FORCES, WOULD HAVE\nTO STUDY AND RECONSIDER THE NEED FOR THE NUMBER OF TROOPS THAT WE\nPRESENTLY HAVE AVAILABLE TO CONFRONT AN IMPOSED SITUATION, AN\nAGGRESSION OF A MARXIST-LENINIST NATURE.  IF AN AGREEMENT IN THIS\nSENSE IS REACHED, WE WOULD BE WILLING TO ANALYZE THE INSTITUTION'S\nINTERNAL SITUATION TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF HUMAN RESOURCES NEEDED\nTO COMPLY WITH OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY.  [END RECORDING]\n\n   THOSE WERE STATEMENTS BY THE DEFENSE MINISTER AT NOON.  HE\nANNOUNCED THAT THE ARMED FORCES WOULD BE WILLING TO STUDY A REDUCTION\nIN FORCES IF AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND REBEL\nCOMMISSIONS AT THE MEETING TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, ON 16\nAND 17 OCTOBER.  GENERAL LARIOS SAID THAT PEACE WILL BE ATTAINED\nBEFORE THE ESTABLISHED DATE IF THE REBELS SHOW THEIR GOOD WILL TO END\nTHE ARMED CONFLICT IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS WAS LAST MINUTE NEWS.  THIS IS\nTHE FIRST TIME A DEFENSE MINISTER HAS MADE SUCH AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE\nPAST 9 YEARS.",

HOWEVER, THEY VOTED IN FAVOR OF CONTINUING WITH\nTHE MILITARY AID [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THEY APPROVED AID THAT WILL BE\nINVESTED IN WAR, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS NOT A SIGN OF PEACE.  THERE WERE\nTWO POSITIONS AT THE SENATE: THOSE WHO ADVOCATED THAT THE AID BE\nDIVIDED IN THREE PACKAGES TO CONTINUE THE DELIVERY OF THE LAST PORTION\nOF THE AID TO THE GOVERNMENT AMID THE DIALOGUE PROCESS, AND THOSE WHO\nWANTED TO GIVE UNCONDITIONAL AID TO CRISTIANI, A POSITION BASICALLY\nDEFENDED BY CHRISTOPHER DODD.  SENATOR DODD HIMSELF SAID THIS AID IS\nALLEGEDLY TO ENCOURAGE CRISTIANI BECAUSE HE IS ACCOMPLISHING WHAT THE\nUNITED STATES HAS BEEN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE PAST 10 YEARS.\n\n   HOWEVER, THE U.S. SENATORS MADE A MISTAKE. THEY VOTED FOR THE\nUNCONDITIONAL AID WHICH ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES THE MILITARY MEN AND THE\nHARDLINERS IN ARENA [NATIONALISTIC REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] WHO ARE\nBLOCKING THE POLITICAL SOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT AND WHO UNREASONABLY\nPROMOTE THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR.  THIS IS NOT A SIGN FOR THE\nMODERATES.

IN SUM,\nTHESE ARE WAR ACTIONS AMID A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR\nNEGOTIATIONS TO ATTAIN PEACE.\n\n   THE U.S. SENATORS MADE A MISTAKE.  WAR ACTIONS IN EL SALVADOR ARE\nCONTRARY TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND CLEARLY COME\nFROM THE [WORDS INDISTINCT], THE ARENA HARDLINERS.

      "text": "   SAN SALVADOR, 23 SEP 89 (CANAL DOCE TELEVISION) -- [REPORT]\n[MAURICIO FUNES] [TEXT] SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT FRANCISCO MERINO\nSTATED TODAY THAT THE MILITARY ASPECTS OF THE AGREEMENTS THAT THE\nGOVERNMENT MAY REDUCTIONS.  ACCORDING TO THE VICE PRESIDENT, AN\nEFFECTIVE CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN MUST ALSO INCLUDE THE\nCONTROL OF VIOLENT ACTIONS BY MASS ORGANIZATIONS IN EL SALVADOR.\nMERINO MADE REFERENCE TO THE DOUBTS THAT CERTAIN MILITARY COMMAND\nSECTORS HAVE ABOUT THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL.  HE SAID THAT THESE DOUBTS ARE\nPRESENT, MAINLY BECAUSE THE REBELS HAVE NOT KEPT THEIR PUBLIC PROMISES\nCONCERNING MILITARY ACTIONS IN THE PAST.  HOWEVER, THE OFFICIAL\nCOMMENTED THAT, IN THE LONG RUN, A CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT WOULD LEAD TO\nNEGOTIATIONS ON IMPORTANT ISSUES, SUCH AS MILITARY TROOP REDUCTIONS,\nTHAT MUST BE ACCEPTED BY THE ARMED FORCES.  LET US HEAR VICE PRESIDENT\nMERINO:\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] WE CANNOT IGNORE THAT THE FMLN AND EVEN\nTHE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HAVE MADE PROMISES THAT THEY NEVER KEPT.  THE\nARMED FORCES ARE A PERMANENT INSTITUTION AND THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY\nSUFFERED THE NONCOMPLIANCE OF AGREEMENTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE BY THE\nPREVIOUS GOVERNMENT WITH THE FMLN.  NOW, THE LACK OF TRUST MUST BE\nOVERCOME WITH SPECIFIC ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE.  HERE, WE HAVE SOMETHING\nTHAT MUST BE CLEARLY APPRECIATED.  THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR\nTHE DIALOGUE PROCESS.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT;\nTHEY ARE AN INSTITUTION.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS THE GENERAL COMMANDER\nOF THE ARMED FORCES.  THUS, THE ARMED FORCES' POSITION IS ALSO\nINCLUDED IN PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S STATEMENTS. [END RECORDING]\n\n   ACCORDING TO MERINO, COMMENTARIES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY SEVERAL\nMILITARY COMMANDERS ARE TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS COMMENTARIES OUTSIDE ANY\nAGREEMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY REACH WITH THE REBELS.  ON THE SAME\nSUBJECT, THE VICE PRESIDENT ALSO COMMENTED THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR\nTHE GUERRILLAS TO CHANGE THEIR MILITARY BEHAVIOR, AS THEY HAVE TO SHOW\nTHAT THEY REALLY WANT TO START A PROGRESSIVE WAR DE-ESCALATION\nPROCESS.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] THE EFFECTIVENESS AND TOTALITY WITH WHICH\nTHE FMLN STOPS HOSTILITIES; CEASES ITS ACTS OF SABOTAGE AGAINST\nELECTRICITY, COMMUNICATIONS, AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES; AND\nSTOPS THE USE OF MINES WILL DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF THE SALVADORAN\nARMY'S OFFENSIVE ACTIONS.  THIS IS LOGICAL, AS WHEN THERE IS NO\nAGGRESSION, THERE CAN BE NO ACTION TO COUNTER IT. [END RECORDING]\n\n   MERINO SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT FOR\nTHE FMLN TO DRASTICALLY DECREASE STREET VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR, SUCH\nAS THE VIOLENCE PROMOTED BY MASS ORGANIZATIONS RECENTLY.\n\n   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] HOSTILITIES ARE NOT ONLY THOSE ACTIONS\nTHAT INCLUDE THE USE OF MILTARY FORCE, SUCH AS MINES, BOMBS, AND SO\nON.  THEY ALSO INCLUDE FMLN MASS ORGANIZATION ACTIONS THAT ARE CARRIED\nOUT MAINLY IN SAN SALVADOR AND ARE CREATING A CERTAIN DEGREE OF\nDESTABILIZATION.  IT IS A KIND OF URBAN TERRORISM, AS THESE GROUPS ARE\nDISTORTING THE RIGHT TO PROTEST OR THE RIGHT OF EXPRESSION.  THESE\nORGANIZATIONS ARE NO LONGER ONLY CARRYING A MESSAGE, BUT HAVE STARTED\nTO DESTROY AND DAMAGE PRIVATE PROPERTY AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, AND\nTHREATEN THE CITIZENS' INTEGRITY.  THUS, YOU SEE HERE A DIRECT\nRELATIONSHIP WHICH DEMANDS THAT THE FMLN MILITARY ACTIONS AND\nCEASEFIRE MUST INCLUDE URBAN ACTIONS, AS WELL.  A CEASEFIRE MUST ALSO\nINCLUDE THAT THE FMLN WILL NOT CARRY OUT OFFENSIVE ACTIONS OR ACTIONS\nBY FACADE GROUPS IN THE CITIES THAT PROMOTE STREET DISORDER.  [END\nRECORDING]\n\n   DURING PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S 15-DAY-ABSENCE, MERINO REPORTED THAT\nHE WILL WORK ON THE PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL PRESENT TO THE\nFMLN IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA ON 16 OCTOBER, WITH AN ADVISORY\nCOMMISSION FORMED BY MILITARY OFFICERS, PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN,\nINTELLECTUALS, AND POLITICAL PARTY LEADERS.

      "text": "   CLANDESTINE, 26 SEP 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [GENERAL\nCOMMAND OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] JUST\n10 DAYS AFTER A DIALOGUE WAS HELD IN MEXICO, THE SITUATION HAS BECOME\nMORE TENSE IN VIEW OF THE GOVERNMENTS AND ARMED FORCE'S ATTITUDE.  THE\nGENERAL COMMAND OF THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION\nFRONT] HEREBY ANNOUNCES THE FOLLOWING:\n\n   1.  THE FMLN HAS SHOWN ITS WILLINGNESS AND FLEXIBILITY BY CARRYING\nOUT UNILATERAL ACTIONS, AND PRESENTING A REALITISTIC PEACE PROPOSAL\nTHAT COVERS THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE ENTIRE NATION IN ENDING THE\nCONFLICT IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.\n\n   2.  ON THE CONTRARY, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE NOT\nMADE ANY EFFORTS, BUT RATHER THEY HAVE HARDENED THEIR STANDS AND\nCARRIED OUT REPRESSIVE ACTIONS.  IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, WHILE WE\nOFFERED A UNILATERAL TRUCE, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE\nCONDUCTED PROVOKING WAR ACTIONS; LAUNCHED MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE\nAREAS UNDER GUERRILLA CONTROL; BOMBED CIVILIAN POPULATIONS IN MORAZAN,\nCHALATENANGO, AND GUAZAPA; MAINTAINED A MILITARY SEIGE ON THE\nUNIVERSITY AND TRADE UNION BUILDINGS; AND EVICTED PEASANTS AND TENANTS\nFROM THEIR LANDS.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN\nUNLEASHING A MERCILESS REPRESSION AGAINST THE ORGANIZATION OF THE\nPEOPLE, TRADE UNIONS, PEASANTS, RELIGIOUS GROUPS, AND STUDENTS.  THE\nNATION HAS BEEN SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT OVER 400 PEOPLE WERE CAPTURED IN\nTHE LAST MONTH.\n\n   DOZENS OF PEOPLE ARE MISSING OR DEAD.  THE FASCIST BRUTAL\nGOVERNMENT IS NOT ASHAMED TO EXHIBIT UNDIGNIFIED PICTURES OF TRADE\nUNION LEADERS -- WHO SHOW SIGNS OF HAVING BEEN TORTURED -- TESTIFYING\nBEFORE JUDGES.  THE GOVERNMENT PUBLICLY SHOWS THE HORROR OF WOMEN WHO\nHAVE BEEN RAPED IN THE PRISONS OF THE NATIONAL POLICE, THE OUTRAGES\nCOMMITTED AGAINST THE BAPTIST CHURCH, AND THE BEATINGS AND THREATS\nAGAINST NEWSMEN.  THE GOVERNMENT EXHIBITS TERRIFYING PHOTOGRAPHS IN\nTHE NEWSPAPERS OF WORKERS TIED BY THEIR THUMBS, AND BLINDFOLDED IN THE\nMOST REPULSIVE STYLES OF THE DEATH SQUADS.\n\n   WE HAVE REACHED SUCH A STATE OF PROVOCATION THAT VICE PRESIDENT\nFRANCISCO MERINO IS TRYING TO HUMILIATE PUBLICLY THE PEOPLE'S SECTORS\nBY CALLING THEM TRASH.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT EVEN TRIED TO SOLVE THE\nCASE OF THE WAR HANDICAPPED; THERE ARE 45 OF THEM OCCUPYING THE\nMETROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL.  THE ONLY ANSWER TO THEIR DEMANDS FOR MEDICAL\nATTENTION ABROAD IS THE RIOT POLICEMEN THAT HAVE BEEN SENT TO THREATEN\nATTACKING [WORDS INDISTINCT] TO ACHIEVE THE FREEDOM OF 11 INNOCENT\nYOUTHS WHO WERE CAPTURED AT A LOCAL CLINIC.  TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,\nTHE U.S. CONGRESS HAS APPROVED SENDING $90 MILLION TO THE FASCIST\nGOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE FINANCING THE WAR AND REPRESSION.\n\n   3.  THIS STATE OF REPRESSION AND THIS MOCKERY TO THE LEGITIMATE\nASPIRATIONS OF THE PEOPLE FOR PEACE IS UNACCEPTABLE.  THE SALVADORAN\nPEOPLE SAY: NO MORE CAPTURES, TORTURE, MURDERS, BOMBINGS, SIEGES,\nEVICTIONS, OR HUMILIATION!\n\n   TO OUR FRIENDS AND ENEMIES, WE SAY THAT JUST LIKE WE REMAIN\nFLEXIBLE AND OPEN FOR NEGOTIATIONS, WE WILL LIKEWISE BE WILLING, ABLE,\nAND READY TO ACCOMPANY THE PEOPLE IN THEIR STRUGGLE AND STRONGLY CARRY\nTHE FLAG OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE TO ADVANCE UNTIL WE HAVE NAILED THAT\nFLAG INTO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ONLY WANT WAR.\n\n   THIS GENERAL COMMAND HEREBY ORDERS ALL OUR GROUPS, FIGHTERS,\nMILITIA MEMBERS, AND COLLABORATORS TO DEFEND WITH HONOR AND STRENGTH\nAND WITH THEIR WEAPONS THE FLAG OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE THAT THE ENTIRE\nNATION DEMANDS.\n\n   WE HEREBY NOTIFY THAT TODAY, 26 SEPTEMBER 1989, OUR FORCES HAVE\nBEGUN A NATIONAL MANEUVER THAT WE CALL \"STOP THE REPRESSION, EVERYONE\nFOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF DEMOCRACY AND PEACE.\" OUR MANEUVER CALLS FOR\nATTACKING SEVERAL GARRISONS AND STRATEGIC POSITIONS OF THE ARMY IN THE\nFOUR REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY.  WE WILL CONTINUE REPORTING ON THE\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE ACTIONS IN THE FOUR WAR FRONTS IN A FORTHCOMING\nCOMMUNIQUE.\n\n   AGAINST REPRESSION, EVERYONE FOR ACHIEVING DEMOCRACY AND PEACE.",

      "text": "   CLANDESTINE, 29 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT]\nTHE FIGHTING IN THE SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTIAL AREAS BRINGS UP\nSUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE FORM AND CONTENT OF THE WAR IN EL\nSALVADOR WHEN THE FIGHTING TAKES PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE\nPOOR AND WHEN THE FIGHTING TAKES PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE\nRICH.  TODAY, WHEN THE FIGHTING TOOK PLACE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE\nCAPITAL CITY, INCLUDING PLACES SUCH AS THE ESCALON, SAN BENITO, SAN\nFRANCISCO, AND GENERAL ARCE RESIDENTIAL AREAS WHERE U.S.  DIPLOMATIC\nPERSONNEL LIVE, WHERE THE MILITARY OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS\nHAVE THEIR RESIDENCES, WHERE THE SALVADORAN HIGH SOCIETY HAS ITS\nRESIDENCES, THEN THE REPERCUSSIONS ARE VERY DIFFERENT.\n\n   U.S. GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN REACTED QUICKLY AND WITHOUT DELAY.\nMARLIN FITZWATER, JAMES BAKER, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AMBASSADOR\nWALKER, EVERYONE WAS VERY WORRIED OVER THE FATE OF U.S. PERSONNEL.\nTHEY EXPRESSED ANGRY WORDS AGAINST THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL\nLIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  IF THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE WORLD THAT IS\nWELL INFORMED OF THE WAR SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, IT IS PRECISELY THE\nPENTAGON, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THE U.S. EMBASSY, BECAUSE THEY\nHAVE FINANCED AND GIVEN ADVICE TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY.\n\n   IT IS NOT OUR PRESENCE IN THE SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTIAL AREAS THAT\nJEOPARDIZES U.S. PERSONNEL.  ON THE CONTRARY, IT IS THE U.S.\nPRESENCE, THE U.S. MEDDLING IN EL SALVADOR THAT IS JEOPARDIZING ITS\nSTAFF.  THEY CANNOT ASK US TO GET OUT OF SAN SALVADOR SO THAT THE\nAMERICANS WILL NOT BE TRAPPED IN THE CROSSFIRE.  IT IS THE U.S.\nINTERVENTION IN THE COUNTRY THAT MUST COME TO AN END, SO THAT WE\nSALVADORANS WILL BE ABLE TO SETTLE OUR PROBLEMS AMONG OURSELVES.  THIS\nIS OUR LAND, OUR FATHERLAND.\n\n   THE WAR WAS IMPOSED BY THE INJUSTICES, THE SLAUGHTERS, THE\nDICTATORSHIPS, AND TO A GREAT EXTENT, BY THE AMERICANS WHO SPEND $1.4\nMILLION DAILY IN THIS WAR.  THIS IS A CRUCIAL MOMENT FOR EL SALVADOR.\nTHAT IS WHY WE DEMAND THAT THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION, THAT IS, THE BUSH\nADMINISTRATION, THE U.S. CONGRESS, AND THE U.S. PEOPLE CAREFULLY THINK\nTHIS OVER AND ACT SENSIBLY SO THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PUT AN END TO\nTHIS WAR.  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT -- THE BUSH\nADMINISTRATION -- THINK THIS OVER AND PROMOTE CHANGES IN ITS POLICY\nTOWARD EL SALVADOR, AND THUS MAKE FEASIBLE A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.\n\n   WE HAVE PUBLICLY AND OFFICIALLY SAID, AS ONE OF OUR MANY GESTURES\nOF GOOD WILL, THAT THE FMLN WILL NOT ATTACK U.S. DIPLOMATIC\nINSTALLATIONS OR PERSONNEL IN EL SALVADOR.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE\nINSTRUCTED OUR UNITS, OUR FIGHTERS, AND COMMANDO GROUPS NOT TO ATTACK\nDIPLOMATIC SITES, BECAUSE NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT MILITARY TARGETS FOR\nTHE FMLN.  WE HOPE THAT IN THE SAME MANNER, BOTH THE U.S. EMBASSY AS\nWELL AS THE OTHER DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES WILL INSTRUCT THEIR\nSECURITY GUARDS SO THEY WILL NOT BECOME INVOLVED IN THE FIGHTING, THUS\nPREVENTING CONFUSION THAT WE WOULD ALL REGRET.\n\n   THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE IN DEFINING THE\nCONFLICT.  THE U.S. CONGRESS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS,\nSUCH AS THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS, ARE ALREADY DISCUSSING THE\nTRUE SITUATION OF OUR COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE MOMENT TO\nCHANGE POLICIES.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CANNOT CONTINUE TO FINANCE AND\nSUPPORT A REGIME WHICH IS BOMBING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE         \nCITIES, A REGIME WHICH MURDERS PRIESTS, WHICH PUBLICLY THREATENS THE     \nBISHOPS.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MUST USE ITS GOOD JUDGMENT AND\nCONTRIBUTE TO THE END OF THE WAR, AND NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A\nFASCIST REGIME THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN OUR FATHERLAND, EL\nSALVADOR.

      "text": "   MOSCOW (USSR), 29 NOV 89 (RADIO PEACE AND PROGRESS) -- [COMMENTARY]\n[ALEKSEY PAVLOV] [TEXT] SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI\nANNOUNCED LAST SUNDAY THAT THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR HAS BROKEN\nDIPLOMATIC TIES WITH NICARAGUA.  ANALYST ALEKSEY PAVLOV DISCUSSES THIS\nSUBJECT:\n\n   FOR THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH CENTRAL AMERICAN ISSUES, THIS NEWS\nIS NO SURPRISE. GIVEN THE FAILURE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE\nSALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS AS WELL AS THE RESUMPTION OF\nTHE WAR, THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION WAS PRESSURED BY CERTAIN U.S.\nCIRCLES TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA.\n\n   THE [WORD INDISTINCT] MEDIA ARE CONDUCTING A CRUSADE TO CONVINCE\nTHE PUBLIC THAT CUBA, NICARAGUA, AND CERTAINLY THE USSR, ARE PROVIDING\nWEAPONS TO THE [WORD INDISTINCT] REVOLUTIONARIES.  THE UNITED STATES\nCERTAINLY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND SO HAS\nPRESIDENT CRISTIANI BY DECLARING THAT HE WILL NOT ATTEND THE REGIONAL\nPRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER IN MANAGUA.\n\n   APPARENTLY, CRISTIANI NEEDED TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA IN\nORDER NOT TO ATTEND TO THE SUMMIT.  THIS IS COMPREHENSIBLE BECAUSE THE\nCENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THE COMPLIANCE\nWITH THE TELA AGREEMENTS, THE DISMANTLING OF THE CONTRAS, AND THE\nCONTINUATION OF PEACE TALKS IN EL SALVADOR. IN FACT, CRISTIANI WAS\nUNABLE TO JUSTIFY HIS REFUSAL TO ATTEND THIS SUMMIT.\n\n   THERE ARE OTHER REASONS WHY CRISTIANI WISHES TO USE THE BREAK WITH\nNICARAGUA AS A MASK.  HE IS TRYING TO DISTRACT PUBLIC ATTENTION FROM\nTHE SALVADORAN ARMY'S HEAVY BOMBINGS OF HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS,\nINCLUDING THE CAPITAL, AND THE REPRESSION AGAINST SALVADORAN RELIGIOUS\nAND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n   IN OTHER TERMS, CRISTIANI WANTS TO CONCEAL THE FACT THAT HE CANNOT\nCONTROL THE EXCESSES COMMITTED BY HIS GENERALS; THAT IS, THE GENOCIDE\nTHAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS PERPETRATING AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE.  THE\nCRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO UNABLE TO CONTROL THE DEATH SQUADS\nWHICH ARE MURDERING PEOPLE WITH IMPUNITY.\n\n   IT IS REVEALING THAT SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE CRISTIANI DECLARED THE\nBREAK OF DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH NICARAGUA, NICARAGUAN EMBASSY STAFF IN\nSAN SALVADOR WERE EVACUATED HOME IN FACE OF THE DEATH THREATS BY THE\nDEATH SQUADS.  IS THIS MERE COINCIDENCE?  OF COURSE NOT.  MOST\nPROBABLY THESE DEATH SQUADS RECEIVED ORDERS TO MAKE SUCH THREATS WITH\nA VIEW TOWARD THE DIPLOMATIC BREAK.\n\n   BY WHAT CAN BE SEEN, THE ACTION OF DEATH SQUADS IS COMMON PRACTICE\nFOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THIS DIPLOMATIC BREAK IS A\nSERIOUS ACT FOR WHICH CRISTIANI IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE.  HONDURAN\nPRESIDENT JOSE AZCONA HOYO CONSIDERS THIS ACTION A GREAT DANGER TO\nPEACE IN THE ISTHMUS.  THIS IS AN UNQUESTIONABLE FACT.  ",

SEVERAL PERSONS WHO WERE HELD\nHOSTAGE THERE ON 30 OCTOBER LATER APPEARED AT THE CENTRAL POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS TO REPORT THE ABUSE.\n\n   WHEN NATIONAL GUARD PERSONNEL BEGAN THE SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION\nTHAT SAME DAY, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE ARRESTED PERSONS HAD\nCOMMITTED OTHER ACTIONS IN VIOLATION OF OUR LAWS AND AGAINST THE\nCOUNTRY'S SECURITY.  AFTER DETERMINING THAT THIS EPISCOPAL CHURCH WAS\nVISITED BY PERSONS INVOLVED IN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES AND THAT IT\nHARBORED A GROUP THAT IS AN FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION\nFRONT] FRONT, THE PLACE WAS SEARCH AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT,\nIN ADDITION TO THE CHURCH, OFFICES OF CREDHO ALSO OPERATED THERE --\nCREDHO IS AN AFFILIATE OF AN ORGANIZATION THEY CALL DIACOMIAS; THAT\n60 PERSONS ARE EMPLOYED THERE; THAT MOST OF THOSE PERSONS ARE NOT\nPARISHIONERS, BUT CREDHO EMPLOYEES; THAT CREDHO'S DIRECTOR IS A PRIEST\nOF SPANISH ORIGIN NAMED LUIS SERRANO LORENTE; AND THAT THIS PRIEST IS\nNOW A NATURALIZED SALVADORAN.\n\n   THERE THE NATIONAL GUARD PERSONNEL ARRESTED JOSE HORACIO GUZMAN\nRIVAS, JOSE EDUARDO SANCHEZ CASTILLO, LUIS GUSTAVO LOPEZ MAGANA, JOSE\nVIDAL ENAMORADO DIAZ, ELBA RUTH ALFARO VALENCIA, ALEX ANTONIO TOVAR\nFLORES, JOSE CANDELARIO AGUILAR ALVAREZ, AND RANDOLFO CAMPO BENAVIDES.\nIN CONNECTION WITH THE SAME CASE, THEY ALSO ARRESTED JUAN ANTONIO\nVERSICO NUNEZ, ANA JULIO RODRIGUEZ, AND JOSE FRANCISCO PASTORANGES\nAT VARIOUS PLACES IN THE CIUDAD SATELITE NEIGHBORHOOD.

      "text": "   BOGOTA, 1 DEC 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]\n[PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] FELLOW PATRIOTS, I AM ADDRESSING THE\nNATION TODAY TO EXPLAIN THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION CONCERNING THE ISSUE\nOF EXTRADITION, WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT OF A VERY INTENSE DEBATE LAST\nNIGHT AT THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES' FIRST COMMISSION.\n\n   A PROPOSAL WAS PUT FORWARD TO THE EFFECT THAT IN THE EXTRAORDINARY\nREFERENDUM SCHEDULED FOR 21 JANUARY -- WHICH IS CONTEMPLATED IN THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL REFORM THAT IS CURRENTLY IN ITS FINAL STAGES -- AN\nADDITIONAL QUESTION BE INCLUDED WITH REGARD TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU, THE\nCOLOMBIAN PEOPLE, WANT COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS TO BE EXTRADITED.\n\n   THIS QUESTION WOULD JOIN FOUR OTHER ISSUES THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN\nAPPROVED FOR SUBMISSION TO POPULAR CONSULTATION ON 21 JANUARY.  ON\nBEHALF OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER IMMEDIATELY\nEXPRESSED THE DISADVANTAGES OF APPROVING THAT PROPOSAL.\n\n   I HAVE CONSULTED WITH FORMER PRESIDENTS ALBERTO LLERAS, CARLOS\nLLERAS RESTREPO, ALFONSO LOPEZ, AND JULIO CESAR TURBAY ABOUT INCLUDING\nTHE EXTRADITION ISSUE IN THE REFERENDUM, AND THEY FEEL THAT WITH THE\nCURRENT PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS\nBEEN DEALING SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING,\nIT WOULD BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO USE THE REFERENDUM TO DECIDE ON\nEXTRADITION.\n\n   THE COUNTRY MUST NOT DECEIVE ITSELF AS TO WHERE WE WOULD BE HEADED\nIF WE HELD A REFERENDUM ON THE ISSUE OF EXTRADITION, AND AS TO THE\nFATAL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH AN ACTION ON THE COUNTRY'S MORALE AND ON\nDEMOCRACY'S SURVIVAL.\n\n   INITIALLY, I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT EXTRADITING COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS\nFOR THEM TO STAND TRIAL IN OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT OF EXTRADITING DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES ABROAD.  EXTRADITION IS NOT\nPUNISHMENT FOR SOCIETY BECAUSE IT REFERS ONLY TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS,\nNEITHER IS IT AN AFFRONT TO SOVEREIGNTY, AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO\nPORTRAY IT.\n\n   EXTRADITION HAS BEEN DEALT WITH IN COLOMBIAN INTERNATIONAL\nTREATIES.  THE DIRECTION OF INTERNATIONAL POLICY LIES WITHIN THE\nEXCLUSIVE REALM OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC, ACCORDING TO THE\nCONSTITUTION.  CONGRESS CANNOT TAKE THE INITIATIVE OF ABOLISHING\nPUBLIC EXTRADITION TREATIES BY RESORTING TO LEGISLATIVE OR CONSTITUENT\nPROVISIONS.  THIS IS CLEAR IN LIGHT OF COLOMBIAN PUBLIC LAW, AND IT IS\nIMPERATIVE ACCORDING TO THE VIENNA CONVENTION, WHICH COLOMBIA RECENTLY\nAPPROVED.  ACCORDING TO THIS CONVENTION, THE EXTRADITION TREATY WILL\nPREVAIL OVER INTERNAL PROVISIONS.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE TREATIES THAT\nCOLOMBIA HAS SIGNED WITH REGARD TO EXTRADITION CANNOT BE DISREGARDED\nTHROUGH INTERNAL LEGISLATION.  THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE THROUGH\nDIPLOMATIC EFFORTS SUCH AS DENOUNCING THE TREATIES AND DIRECTLY\nINFORMING THE COUNTERPART.\n\n   FOR 100 YEARS COLOMBIAN LAW HAS AUTHORIZED THE EXTRADITION OF\nCRIMINALS.  I REPEAT, 100 YEARS, SINCE 1888, AND ONLY NOW, WHEN\nEXTRADITION IS APPLIED TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS, ARE THERE OBJECTIONS TO\nITS ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF SOVEREIGNTY.  PRACTICALLY ALL THE COUNTRIES\nOF THE WORLD, WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTION, HAVE AND APPLY TREATIES TO\nEXTRADITE TERRORISTS OR WHOMEVER COMMITS CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, SUCH\nAS DRUG TRAFFICKING.\n\n   OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, NO MORE THAN 30 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXTRADITED\nTO SEVERAL COUNTRIES THAT REQUESTED THE EXTRADITIONS AND COMPLIED WITH\nTHE NECESSARY LAWS.  THEREFORE, EXTRADITION IS NOT A GENERAL THREAT\nAGAINST ALL COLOMBIANS.  IT ONLY AFFECTS THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED THE\nCRIME OF DRUG TRAFFICKING ABROAD.  SECONDLY, SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID\nTHAT EXTRADITION HAS CREATED VIOLENCE AND, THEREFORE, WITH ITS\nELIMINATION, VIOLENCE WOULD DISAPPEAR.  NEITHER IS TRUE.\n\n   THE VIOLENCE PERPETRATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD BEEN SUFFERED\nPRIOR TO THE 1979 EXTRADITION TREATY.  AFTER THE TREATY WENT INTO\nEFFECT, HUNDREDS OF COLOMBIANS WERE MURDERED, INCLUDING JUSTICE\nMINISTER RODRIGO LARA BONILLA.  IN DECEMBER 1986, A SUPREME COURT\nDECISION LEFT THE EXTRADITION TREATY INAPPLICABLE.  IN OTHER WORDS,\nAFTER THIS, WHILE EXTRADITION WAS INAPPLICABLE, ATTORNEY GENERAL\nCARLOS MAURO HOYOS WAS SLAIN, BOGOTA MAYOR ANDRES PASTRANA WAS\nKIDNAPPED, AND NEWSMAN GUILLERMO CANO, POLITICAL LEADER JAIME PARDO\nLEAL, AND HUNDREDS OF COLOMBIANS WERE SACRIFICED.

      "text": "   BOGOTA, 1 DEC 89 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]\n[PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] [CONTINUED] LAST YEAR, WITHOUT\nEXTRADITION IN EFFECT, OVER 600 ANONYMOUS COLOMBIAN PEASANTS WERE\nMURDERED IN MORE THAN 40 MASSACRES BY HIRED ASSASSINS PAID BY DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS.  THERE IS EVEN MORE: LET US NOT FORGET ANTIOQUIA GOVERNOR\nANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR, MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA, COLONEL FRANKLYN\nQUINTERO, AND SENATOR LUIS CARLOS GALAN WHO WERE MURDERED WHEN\nEXTRADITION WAS NOT IN EFFECT.  LET US NOT SAY THAT EXTRADITION HAS\nBROUGHT US VIOLENCE.  A POSTER FOUND AT THE FARM RAIDED LAST WEEK,\nFROM WHERE PABLO ESCOBAR ESCAPED READ: EXTRADITION IS VIOLENCE.  LET\nUS NOT BE FOOLED; VIOLENCE HAS BEEN USED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS BY\nMURDERING, WHILE FLEEING FROM THE REACTION OF JUSTICE, AND\nINTIMIDATING COLOMBIAN SOCIETY.  IT HAS ALSO BEEN SAID THAT\nEXTRADITION IS UNDIGNIFIED BECAUSE IT SENDS COLOMBIANS ABROAD TO BE\nTRIED, AND THAT IT IS MORE DIGNIFIED FOR THEM TO BE TRIED AND\nCONDEMNED IN THE COUNTRY BY OUR OWN JUDGES.  THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS,\nHOWEVER, HAVE SENT MORE THAN 200 COLOMBIAN JUDGES AND JUDICIAL BRANCH\nOFFICIALS TO THEIR GRAVE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE\nMURDER OF DR GUILLERMO CANO HAS MEANT THE DEATH OF WITNESSES, JUDICIAL\nOFFICIALS, AND LAWYERS AND INTIMIDATION AND THREATS TO ALL THOSE WHO\nWANT TO COOPERATE WITH JUSTICE TO RESOLVE A CRIME.  HOW THEN CAN WE\nBELIEVE THESE DRUG TRAFFICKERS?  CAN WE BELIEVE THAT EXTRADITION HAS\nCAUSED THIS VIOLENCE?  CAN WE HAVE A FREE AND DIGNIFIED COUNTRY WITH\nTHESE BANDS OF MULTIMILLIONAIRE MURDERERS?\n\n   I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS IT\nHARMFUL AND DANGEROUS TO SUBMIT EXTRADITION TO A REFERENDUM.  WE KNOW\nTHAT EXTRADITION IS ONLY FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  WE KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE\nDONE AND WHAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DOING.  WE HAVE SUFFERED FROM THEIR\nTERRORIST ACTIONS.  MANY BRAVE COLOMBIANS HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR THE\nSIMPLE REASON OF NOT AGREEING WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING.  DO YOU BELIEVE\nTHAT ON THIS TOPIC OF EXTRADITION THERE COULD BE A CLEAN ELECTORAL\nCAMPAIGN, FREE FROM INTIMIDATION?  DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO ARE\nAGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING CAN, WITHOUT FEAR, GIVE THEIR OPINION?  IT\nWOULD BE A CAMPAIGN SLANTED BY TERRORISM, INTIMIDATION, AND DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS' MONEY.\n\n   THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT SUBJECT CITIZENS TO AN ELECTORAL PROCESS THAT\nWOULD NOT BE TO CONVINCE COLOMBIANS, BUT TO INTIMIDATE THEM.  A\nREFERENDUM IS FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR FREE AND SOVEREIGN DECISION\nON A TOPIC OF GENERAL INTEREST.  TO INCLUDE EXTRADITION IN THE\nREFERENDUM WOULD ONLY SERVE SO THAT A HANDFUL -- LESS THAN 100 -- DRUG\nTRAFFICKERS CAN, BY USING THEIR MONEY AND TERROR, INTIMIDATE PUBLIC\nOPINION, THE MEDIA, AND ALL COLOMBIANS, SO AS TO AVOID BEING TRIED AND\nCONDEMNED FOR CRIMES THAT THEY HAD COMMITTED ABROAD.\n\n   CONDITIONS OF TERRORISM DO NOT ALLOW THIS TOPIC TO BE DECIDED\nFREELY.  I CALL FOR GOOD SENSE, FOR SENSIBLENESS, SO THAT THE DARK\nINTERESTS OF A FEW PRIVATE PEOPLE ARE NOT CONFUSED WITH THE GENERAL\nINTEREST OF ALL COLOMBIANS.  I CALL FOR COLOMBIANS NOT TO ALLOW THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS THAT ARE IN THE FINAL DISCUSSION, OR THE FIRST\nREFERENDUM IN OVER 30 YEARS, TO BE USED IN AN OPPORTUNISTIC WAY TO\nSERVE SELFISH INTERESTS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS CONVINCED THAT THE\nCONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND THE EXTRAORDINARY REFERENDUM WILL BE AN\nIMPORTANT ADVANCEMENT FOR THE INSTITUTIONS.  THEY WILL ALLOW GREATER\nPARTICIPATION BY THE PEOPLE IN STATE DECISIONS, IN CONGRESS, AND ARE\nWITHOUT DOUBT A STEP TOWARD PEACE.  I KNOW THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY THAT\nDRUG TRAFFICKERS WANT PEACE AND TRANQUILITY.  I WANT TO SAY THAT\nELIMINATING EXTRADITION WILL NOT BRING TRANQUILITY, BUT IMPUNITY AND\nMORE VIOLENCE.  THIS IS WHY IT IS ADVISABLE THAT PARLIAMENTARIANS NOT\nALLOW INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES TO BE ENDANGERED OR THE PEACE ACCORDS BE\nPUT TO SERIOUS RISK DUE TO THE INCLUSION IN THE REFERENDUM OF A TOPIC\nTHAT NOT ONLY WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT WOULD BE\nDANGEROUS TO ALL COLOMBIANS.\n\n   AS IS PUBLICLY KNOWN, I WILL TRAVEL ON 3 DECEMBER AT THE OFFICIAL\nINVITATION OF THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS PART OF COLOMBIA'S\nOPENING TO THE PACIFIC.  THERE, I SHALL MEET WITH EMPEROR AKIHITO;\nWITH PRIME MINISTER TOSHIKI KAIFU; WITH THE LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS; WITH\nINDUSTRIAL, POLITICAL, AND ACADEMIC LEADERS; AND WITH JAPANESE\nGOVERNMENT LENDING AND TRADE ENTITIES.  THERE, I SHALL PRESENT A TRUE\nPICTURE OF COLOMBIA -- A COUNTRY WITH DIFFICULTIES, BUT WITH THE\nNATIONAL RESOLVE TO OVERCOME THEM.  WE ARE A COUNTRY WITH A PROMISING\nFUTURE, WITH HARD-WORKING PEOPLE, AND WITH VAST NATURAL RESOURCES.  A\nFEW CRIMINALS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SNATCH THAT FUTURE FROM US.  GOOD\nNIGHT, AND SEE YOU SOON.  ",

IT ALSO\nCONDEMNS THE \"BRUTAL WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE MASSACRED, WHICH PROVES\nHOW FAR DOWN THE MORAL SENSE AND HUMAN QUALITY OF THOSE WHO\nPERPETRATED THE CRIME HAS FALLEN.\"\n\n   REGARDING PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, THE HIGHEST RANKING LEADERS OF\nTHE CHURCH IN THE AREA POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE MANY FACTORS\nPREVENTING OR HAMPERING EFFORTS TO BUILD A LONG LASTING PEACE.\n\n   AMONG THE FACTORS THE BISHOPS MENTION IS \"THE PERSISTENCE OF\nSERIOUS SOCIAL PROBLEMS -- HUNGER, UNEMPLOYMENT, THE HIGH COST OF\nLIVING, AND THE REALITY OF AN UNDERPRIVILEGED CLASS -- YET MOST RULERS\nAND OTHER BODIES HOLDING POWER DO NOT SHOW ANY DESIRE TO ELIMINATE\nTHESE FACTORS.\"\n\n   IN ADDITION, THE \"CRIMINAL STUBBORNNESS\" OF SEARCHING FOR A\nMILITARY AND ARMED SOLUTION TO THE SITUATION OF VIOLENCE HAS GENERATED\n\"THE DEEPLY ROOTED UNJUSTICE IN OUR REALITY, WHICH IS AGGRAVATED BY\nTHE OUTRAGEOUS MEDDLING OF FOREIGN SUPERPOWERS.\"\n\n   \"THE INTEREST OF A GROUP OR IDEOLOGIES PREVAIL OVER THE NEEDS AND\nRIGHTS OF CITIZENS,\" THE SEDAC DOCUMENTS STATES.  THE HEADS OF THE\nCHURCHES OF THE SIX ISTHMIAN COUNTRIES ADD THAT THIS HASTENS THE\n\"CRIMINAL AND IMMORAL\" ARMS BUILDUP, WHICH, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF\nCOSTA RICA, HAS LED PEOPLE IN THE AREA INTO INCREASING IMPOVERISHMENT\nAND A RISE IN THEIR FOREIGN DEBT.\n\n   \"THE SMUGGLING OF WEAPONS TO STRENGTHEN SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS OF\nVARIOUS TENDENCIES IS NO LESS OUTRAGEOUS AND CRIMINAL THAN THE\nEXISTENCE OF DEATH SQUADS OR PARAMILITARY GROUPS,\" THE SEDAC DOCUMENT\nADDS.\n\n   IT IS WORRYING TO SEE HOW SOME NATIONS IN THE AREA PROMOTE\nCAMPAIGNS SUCH AS \"AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH\"\n(PANAMA), OR PROMOTE \"ANTITERRORIST\" LAWS (EL SALVADOR) THAT CAN BE\nUSED FOR THE OUTRAGEOUS ABUSE OF POWER IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE\nADVERSARIES, THE BISHOPS POINTED OUT.\n\n   TO ALL THESE EVILS ONE MUST ADD THE FLIGHT OF CAPITAL, THE\nINCREASING DRUG TRAFFICKING, AND THE RESULTING CORRUPTION, VIOLENCE,\nAND DEATH.

IT IS STUDYING WHETHER IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO\nSUPPORT A FASCIST PARTY AND A CRIMINAL-RIDDEN ARMED FORCES AND THUS\nCONDEMN THIS PART OF THE WORLD SO CLOSE TO THEIR BORDERS TO TERRIBLE\nSUFFERING, OR WHETHER THE TIME OF CHANGE HAS ARRIVED IN THE UNITED\nSTATES.  THE POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR MUST BE CHANGED TO ACHIEVE THE\nGOAL OF DEMOCRACY SO THAT PLURALISM WILL GIVE WAY TO DEMOCRACY,\nJUSTICE, AND PEACE.  THE UNITED STATES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE IN EL\nSALVADOR, BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO IT MUST CHANGE ITS POLICY.  ",

      "text": "   LA PAZ, 4 DEC 89 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS THAT\nRESULTED IN JAIME PAZ ZAMORA'S INSTALLATION AS PRESIDENT OF THE\nREPUBLIC WILL AGAIN TAKE PLACE IN THE NEXT WEEKS TO DECIDE WHO WILL BE\nINSTALLED AS MAYOR OF LA PAZ.\n\n   THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS HELD YESTERDAY DID NOT CLEARLY INDICATE WHO\nWILL BE THE MAYOR OF THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST CITY, WHERE THE CANDIDATES\nOF THE POPULIST NEW POLITICAL GROUPS AND THOSE OF THE TRADITIONAL\nPARTIES RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY THE SAME NUMBER OF VOTES.\n\n   ACCORDING TO UNOFFICIAL RETURNS RELEASED BY THE PRIVATE TELEVISION\nCHANNELS, WHICH IN PREVIOUS ELECTIONS HAVE PROVEN TO BE VERY SIMILAR\nTO THOSE OF THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COURT, CARLOS PALENQUE, 45, A RADIO\nAND TELEVISION BUSINESSMAN AND THE LEADER OF THE CONSCIENCE OF THE\nFATHERLAND (CONDEPA), HAS RECEIVED MOST OF THE VOTES.\n\n   PALENQUE RECEIVED 39.9 PERCENT OF THE VOTES CAST IN LA PAZ, THEREBY\nGIVING CONDEPA 5 OF THE 13 SEATS ON THE TOWN COUNCIL, WHICH WILL ELECT\nTHE MAYOR OF LA PAZ ON 2 JANUARY.\n\n   THE ALLIANCE OF THE RIGHT WING NATIONALIST DEMOCRATIC ACTION (ADN)\nAND THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT (MIR) HAS\nALSO WON FIVE TOWN COUNCIL SEATS.\n\n   RONALD MACLEAN, 40 AND OF SCOTTISH ANCESTRY, THE MAYORAL CANDIDATE\nOF THE ADN-MIR ALLIANCE, HAS OBTAINED 36.8 PERCENT OF THE VOTES IN LA\nPAZ, WHERE HE HAS BEEN THE MAYOR SINCE L985.\n\n   FAR BEHIND WERE THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION'S PARTY, THE NATIONALIST\nREVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR), WHICH RECEIVED TWO SEATS, AND THE\nPOPULIST SOLIDARITY CIVIC UNION (UCS), LED BY BREWERY OWNER MAX\nFERNANDEZ, WITH ONE TOWN COUNCIL SEAT.\n\n   THE DECISION AS TO WHO WILL BE THE NEW LA PAZ MAYOR ON 2 JANUARY IS\nNOW IN THE HANDS OF THE MNR, BUT ITS LEADERS DECLINED TO COMMENT ON\nTHEIR POSITION LAST NIGHT.\n\n   GONZALO SANCHEZ DE LOSADA, THE LEADER OF THE MNR, LAST NIGHT SAID\nON TELEVISION: \"WE MUST BE EXTREMELY SERIOUS IN SEARCHING FOR A\nSOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM, OR THE PEOPLE WILL TURN THEIR BACKS ON\nPOPULISM.\"\n\n   HE SAID HIS DECISION WILL BE \"A CHRISTMAS PRESENT.\"  HE INSISTED,\nHOWEVER, THAT IN HIS OPINION THE GOVERNING ADN-MIR ALLIANCE \"WILL\nEASILY FIX THINGS BETWEEN THEM\" BECAUSE \"THEY ARE TWO OF A KIND.\"\n\n   ALTHOUGH THE MNR WAS THE PARTY TO RECEIVE MOST OF THE VOTES IN THE\n7 MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, IT WAS DUE TO AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN TWO\nOLD POLITICAL ENEMIES -- THE ADN AND MIR -- THAT JAIME PAZ ZAMORA, WHO\nHAD COME THIRD IN THE ELECTIONS, WAS INSTALLED AS PRESIDENT OF THE\nREPUBLIC. \"IF WE APPLIED THIS SAME RULE TO THE CURRENT PROBLEM,\"\nSANCHEZ DE LOSADA SAID JOKINGLY, \"GUIDO CAPRA (MNR CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR\nOF LA PAZ) WOULD BE ELECTED.\"\n\n   SANCHEZ DE LOSADA POINTED OUT THAT PALENQUE WAS ONE OF THE\nSUPPORTERS OF THE ADN-MIR GOVERNING ALLIANCE, WHICH PREVENTED SANCHEZ\nDE LOSADA FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT.\n\n   ACCORDING TO THE OPPOSITION, PALENQUE'S PARTY GAINED THE LA PAZ\nDEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (CORDEPAZ) AND \"HALF A MINISTRY\" (REFERRING TO\nTHE COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORTATION MINISTRY) AS A RESULT OF THE\nALLIANCE.  SANCHEZ DE LOSADA WARNED THE BOLIVIAN POLITICIANS THAT\nPALENQUE'S POPULIST GROUP, WHICH IS GROWING VERY FAST, HAS ITS EYES\nSET \"ON THE L993 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, NOT ONLY ON THE LA PAZ\nMAYORSHIP.\"\n\n   WHILE RESPECT WAS SHOWN TOWARD RONALD MACLEAN, THE CANDIDATE MOST\nCRITICIZED BY THE MNR DURING THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS CAMPAIGN WAS\nPALENQUE.\n\n   PALENQUE STATED, HOWEVER, THAT THE COUNCILMEN WHO ON 2 JANUARY WILL\nELECT THE NEXT MAYOR OF LA PAZ MUST \"RESPECT THE WILL OF THE\nMAJORITY.\"\n\n   \"WE HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE NO NEGOTIATION (AMONG PARTIES) AND THAT\nTHE DESIRE OF THE MAJORITY WILL BE RESPECTED,\" PALENQUE STATED.  HE IS\nWELL KNOWN, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE BEARD HE WEARS, WHICH MAKES HIM\nLOOK VERY MUCH LIKE FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\n\n   PALENQUE, WHO IS CERTAIN OF THE SUPPORT HE WILL RECEIVE FROM THE\nONLY UCS COUNCILMAN IN LA PAZ, FEARS THAT A PACT BETWEEN THE ADN-MIR\nCOALITION AND THE MNR WILL PREVENT HIM FROM OBTAINING THE MAYORSHIP OF\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT CITY IN THE COUNTRY.\n\n   SUCH AN ALLIANCE, HOWEVER, WITH A GREATER IDEOLOGICAL BASIS THAN\nANY OTHER, WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME THE GRUDGE THAT THE MNR BEARS BECAUSE\nTHE ADN AND THE MIR \"HAD STOLEN FROM IT\" THE PRESIDENCY OF THE\nREPUBLIC DURING THE LAST ELECTIONS, ACCORDING TO COMMENTATORS.\n\n   \"WE ARE GOING TO BE VERY RESPONSIBLE, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE\nMOTIVATED BY PERSONAL INTERESTS OR BY ANY VENGEANCE,\" SANCHEZ DE\nLOSADA STATED, COMMENTING ON THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WILL TAKE PLACE TO\nDESIGNATE THE MAYOR OF LA PAZ.\n\n   LIKE IN LA PAZ, THE GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE WILL HAVE TO NEGOTIATE\nSUPPORT IN THE OTHER MAJOR BOLIVIAN CITIES, WHERE THE COALITION CAME\nIN FIRST BUT FAILED TO WIN ABSOLUTE MAJORITIES.\n\n   THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS SUCRE, WHERE THE CANDIDATE OF THE UNITED LEFT\nCOALITION, RADIO REPORTER OMAR MONTALVO, OBTAINED 57.3 PERCENT OF THE\nVOTES, WHICH IS SUFFICIENT TO OBTAIN THE MAYORSHIP.\n\n   THE MOST OUTSTANDING POINTS ABOUT THE ELECTIONS WERE THE ABSTENTION\nOF BETWEEN 30 AND 50 PERCENT OF THE VOTERS AND THE ALMOST ABSOLUTE\nNORMALCY DURING THE ELECTIONS.\n\n   THE STATE OF SIEGE DECREED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ON 15 NOVEMBER\nDUE TO STREET CONFRONTATIONS CAUSED BY SOCIAL DISTURBANCES DID NOT\nHAMPER THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.\n\n   THE TRADITIONAL RESTRICTIONS, HOWEVER, AFFECTED TRAFFIC AND\nHAMPERED PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, KEEPING VOTERS FROM CASTING THEIR\nVOTES. THE ABSTENTION WAS ALSO CAUSED BY THE WEARINESS OF THE VOTERS,\nWHO ARE VOTING FOR THE FOURTH TIME IN 4 YEARS.  ",
